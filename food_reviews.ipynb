      "[u'Most gluten-free products taste like cardboard, so when I came upon this sampler, I was happily surprised.  Measurably better tasting than sports\\' bars and gluten-free breakfast bars, this organic snack recharges your energy and rejuvenates your spirits.  Now don\\'t expect a health product of this caliber to be inexpensive.  I\\'m happy that PURE is very competitively priced at less than two dollars per bar.Surprisingly, I liked the \"Cherry Cashew\" flavor over \"Wild Blueberry,\" but the variety can keep you more than satisfied.Nutrition *****, high in omega-3 and fiber, gluten-free, and organic.Price  ***, You get what you pay for.Taste  ****, So fresh, so good.Value  ****, Seldom do you get everything together in one bar.', u'SO this is an unusual version of a healthy snak/power bar. Im slightly torn about the texture/taste and consistancy. Its not bad, and it not great.. more like.. ehhhh?! If your loking for something different, then this is it otherwise stick to what you already like.', u\"I was looking for a relatively natural, decent tasting, low glycemic index bar.  These aren't very filling and don't taste that great.  Given I am hungry a half hour later, I wonder if they are not low glycemic, or if they are just insubstantial.I find that I prefer either Luna Mojo bars which are low glycemic and much more filling or GNU foods Flavor and Fiber bars.\", u\"Aside from PURE bars being nutritious, organic, GF, Vegan and all around good for you....they taste amazing! I love bananas and coconut alone...so this combination was love at first bite for me. It's satisfying and a great snack for 'on the go'. Don't reach for a vending machine candy bar loaded with garbage...you can eat a PURE bar with wholesome natural sweetness.\", u\"The bars themselves just don't suit my tastes at all.  I was giving them away because the flavors were a bit off for me.  At these calories I expect something to taste great.\", u'.....and Completely Organic. The texture is like that of a dried fruit pie (actually, this is a compliment) that you can get at some bakeries -- it was moist enough to enjoy without having to drink water at the same time. Although I could not actually taste the wild blueberries (the first ingredient was Dates -- the blueberries were the fifth ingrdient, and organic blueberry flavor was the last ingredient) the bar was enjoyable and sweet without the use of refined sugar.The list of ingredients includes dates, nuts, rice protein, lemon juice. Because I am hypoglygemic, after eating the bar I waited and waited and...there was no sugar high! And since I am also Gluten sensitive, it was very nice to know that there is no gluten here either. This would be a good source of energy to me when camping or hiking.There is Zero sodium in this bar, as well.', u\"These were really good. Dates are used as the base for every flavor. Each bar has about 200 calories. The Pineapple banana tasted mostly like banana bread. All four flavors have some sort of nut in them. The brownie has walnuts in it, doesn't taste much like a brownie but has cocoa flavor and the texture is pretty similar to a little debbie's brownie. There is a warning on the side about shells possibly being in the bar and I've gotten them so often I would NOT recommend giving these to children as a snack unless they are old enough to know to be careful.\", u'These are ok, but a bit too tart IMO.Not a knock on the product, but amazon vine promised a pack of 12, I only received one bar.', u\"I wasn't a fan of the taste of this variety.  I have tried both the blueberry and the cherry cashew, and I much prefer the blueberry.  The size is adequate for a snack, and the texture is fine - I was just put off by the taste.I like that these use organic ingredients and are primarily a fruit and nut bar. It would make me feel better about snacking than if I were to eat a candy bar. However, I wouldn't get this flavor if given a choice.\", u\"I like it!It's got fruit and nuts, but it's not like a dried fruit bar or a granola bar. It's not crunchy and hard.It's moist and chewy!  It's semi-soft and chewable and you can really taste the Cherries and the nuts!It's a fair sized bar(1.7 oz - 48g) - I would have liked it if it were a bit bigger.  190 calories, 70 fromfat.  It contains dates cashews, cherries rice protein walnuts agave and almonds - all organic.  I plan onbuying these when they're available!One warning - I could easily see people eating too many of these - they taste really good!\", u'Firstly, I thought I\\'d be getting a box of these thru Vine, but once I tasted this bar, I wasn\\'t disappointed any more that I only got one. I did think it rather humorous, however, that this huge box contained one little bar.These smell really good, probably due to the fruit juice used as the sugar source in them. And the flavor is nutty and tastes very much like blueberries, moreso than most \"blueberry\" products. But that\\'s where the pleasurable parts end. The texture is like someone sat on your Great Aunt\\'s fruitcake on a long trip to Oshkosh and then gave you a slice. It seems compacted and gooey. Nothing you\\'d want more than one of. Ever.Solution to factory-made bars? I have been making my own for about 3 months now. I use whole wheat flour, wheat germ, whole oats, vanilla, bananas, dates, raisins, figs, dried cranberries, hazelnuts, coconut, honey, eggs and brown sugar. Sometimes I add bits of organic chocolate. That\\'s it. I bake them for about an hour and they are light, fluffy, chewy and fantastic. They only take about 10 minutes to mix up and cost about 2/3rds less than a box of granola bars and I get about 3 times more bars. And each one is practically a meal because I cut them large.Why can I do this so cheaply, quickly and easily, yet a food factory with a big budget can\\'t seem to make a decent granola bar? Overhead and corporate silliness, I guess.', u\"I go through a lot of protein bars. That's what happens when you forget to eat and need to regain brain functionality before driving. This one is good. So good, my super picky eater kiddo snatched it out of my hands and gobbled it up before I knew what he was doing. It smells great, tastes even better and is now a staple in our house.\", u'I enjoyed this cherry cashew date bar.. until i almost broke a tooth on a nut shell fragment.  Ouch.  That happens with processed nuts, though.Wait, the package says \"Nothing processed.\" as part of it\\'s natural-organic hype.  That\\'s a little dishonest IMHO (it takes \"processing\" to remove nut shells and to get the nectar from agave plants).Likes:* Good texture, flavor.* Reasonable sugar content @ 17g.* Very low sodium.* 3g fiber, 7g protien.* Organic ingredients.Dislikes:* Hype on the packaging is a little excessive.  \"No refined sugars\", ok, but agave nectar is processed, refined (well, reduced) and just as bad for you (see recent studies).* Nut shell fragment--ouch--hope that is rare.Overall this is a tasty snack, especially if you have a restrictive diet (gluten free and vegan).', u\"I am an opportunistic eater, no real dietary concerns, so most of the selling points didn't really reach me.I purchased the Cherry Cashew bars and they are tasty! It tastes of dates, cherries, and nuts, but it is not to sweet or tart. I eat this with a cup of black coffee and it is a perfect breakfast/snack.I will try the other flavors. I'm sold!\", u\"I would recommend these at the right price but note that they are date bars with a hint of blueberry. Blueberries are not found until #5 on the ingredient list.  I was hoping for a stronger blueberry flavor.  I'm happy enough at the deep discounted price I paid but it wont be a regular purchase for me.\", u\"Having triedPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12), I was expecting the Cherry Cashew to be similar in taste. For better or worse, this is not the case.Cherry Cashew is all natural, not processed, raw, no preservatives added, healthy snack (based on calorie content it is healthier than eating candy bars or Luna and Cliff Bars).The bar's best feature is that it is certainly chewy, yet it doesn't stick to your teeth at all.The most disappointing feature of this bar, however, is that it has the barest taste of cherry and cashew. Whereas the Wild Blueberry was heavily condensed with blueberries and one could truly feel the berries on one's tongue, one only has a hint of cherries in the Cherry Cahew bar. The dates are also less prominent in the Cherry Cashew when compared to the taste of dates in the Wild Blueberry bar.This bar is tasty, but I would endorse the purchase of the Wild Blueberry and would feel inclined to purchase Wild Blueberry and would only get the cherry Cashew for variety.\", u\"I don't like artificial candy flavors and this bar tastes much better in comparison. It's been a long time since I ate a fig newton, but this tastes similar to me, only with blueberries instead of figs. However, I like to limit my calorie intake and at 190 calories, this bar is not a quick snack, it's a substantial part of my lunch or an entire breakfast. Frankly, I prefer raw fresh blueberries. They're lower calorie and they taste, well, fresher.\", u'The Chocolate Brownie PURE Raw Fruit and Nut Bar! And it will take care of your sweet tooth, without breaking the tooth off. So many \"health bars\" on the market will endanger your teeth and if you have lots of fillings like I do, watch out! The PURE Bars are chewy in a tooth-friendly way, and the Chocolate Brownie consists of dates, nuts, organic cocoa, and very few other ingredients, simply smashed together into a marvelous consistency. It\\'s  sweet, without having that extreme sugar aftertaste one gets from a candy bar, and its 190 calories are a good nutritional investment, because this is all healthy stuff. It also has only 5 mg. of sodium for those on salt restricted diets. as the package says, \"NO Artificial Nothin\"!I\\'ve also tried the Cherry/Cashew PURE Bar, and the Wild Blueberry. The Cherry is much sweeter, and if you\\'re having a desperate \"sweet tooth fit\" will be the winner. Wild Blueberry is mighty fine too, but not as sweet and much blander. The Chocolate Brownie is less sweet than the Cherry/Cashew, with a very dark chocolately taste, and is totally yummy.With \"Nothing Cooked, Nothing Processed,\" and all its wonderful ingredients, PURE Bars are a truly great snack. So indulge!', u'Although I love organic foods and I especially love blueberries, I have to admit I was quite disappointed with the Wild Blueberry bar from Pure. Not only did it had the texture and taste of a bad fruitcake, but it was less nutritious than a comparative bar like something from Luna or Cliff. It also containing a whopping 14% of your daily fat intake. The only real value of the bar is in terms of copper and dietary fiber, both of which you can get in many other things and with far less fat. Perhaps a Fiber One bar which has less calories than this and 45% of your fiber instead of 16%All in all, I love that Pure bars are mostly organic, but they have no flavour or any actual health benefits. It\\'s kind of a sham meant to prey on people that just see the word \"organic\" and assume something is actually good for them. Stay away.', u'The PURE WILD BLUEBERRY BAR is pretty good for a quick and healthy snack. It tastes like a blueberry muffin with walnuts in it. I\\'m not a big fan of walnuts, they taste like stale nuts to me, but thankfully PURE doesn\\'t go overboard with them in the PURE BLUEBERRY BAR, and there\\'s also a mix of cashews in it.I like that the bar is soft, moist, semi-sweet and made with real fruit. It has the \"USDA Organic\" stamp and is certified \"Gluten-Free,\" for those who have gluten allergies, but it does contain nuts, so that\\'s a heads up for those peanut/nut allergies.Although each bar has 190-calories and 8g of fat, I figure most of those numbers come from the added nuts.Anyway, as long as you eat these bars in moderation, I think the PURE WILD BLUEBERRY BARS are a great alternative to other snack bars that are full of processed fruit, chemicals, and added sugar.', u\"I was reluctant to try these as I've always heard heinous taste reviews about health food bars, but the sound of cherries and cashews convinced me to give them a shot.  Contrary to assumption, they don't taste like a stick of cardboard!  They are tasty, healthy, and filling.  I am always on the go and I am going to stock up on these to keep one in my bag at all times.  If you've been steering clear of health food bars, give these a try!\", u'I really wanted to like these but they are so dense and just like a condensed goo brick with almost no flavor. The texture is gross and the bars that do have any discernable flavor are so gross it makes me gag. I would never buy these again. Not ever. Especially not banana. Omg so gross. Even the memory of the taste and texture makes me sick.', u'Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew raw fruit and nut bar is not for me.  It was like eating an unbaked blob of dough mixed with bits of nuts and tart unripe cherries.  I would rather eat a cherry pop tart than this.', u\"If you like cherries, especially dried, you'll LOVE these! The cashews are there, and just right... not over-done.Wow! Great tasting bars for those on the go! Better tasting than most quick meal bars! (OK, so not really a meal, but sometimes you've got to just grab something & go!A little smaller than a lot of bars on the market, but tastes great, is organic & a great item to throw in your car, purse or emergency kit!Also, a great healthy snack for kids too! Great for lunches or snack time!Schools ought to be selling these in vending machines instead of sugar-filled granola bars w/ chocolate on them!!! (Yikes!)No artificial junk in these! They are certified organic (& taste like it too... doesn't taste like chemically fertilized foods or those sprayed upon!)Great for those on a raw, vegan diet as well! Toss those well known, sugar-filled, supposedly healthy bars & get these! They are a LOT healthier & taste a LOT better too!NOT for those allergic to nuts!\", u'Pure\\'s Cherry Cashew fruit and nut bar is a filling & healthy snack. When you are running errands by yourself or with the kids, this is a perfect appetite quencher to have in your purse, car, or backpack. I would take it over any of the breakfast bars & energy bars that I\\'ve seen on the market. My second choice would be a Cliff bar.In comparing these to Clif bars, I would say that the Clif bars are just as healthy but I don\\'t find them to be as filling. Also, these are a little softer than the Clif bars I\\'ve eaten. I like that the nuts are soft and not crunchy as my new dental work can\\'t take the hard nuts.Some fruit and nut bars are a little tart for my taste. These are very balanced - not too sweet, not too tart. The blueberry flavor is just right. It is not so strong that it taste\\'s fake, but you know you\\'re eating a blueberry fruit bar.If you like something with a little lest tang and just a little less chewy feel, try Pure\\'s Wild Blueberry bar.For those of you who like a bar with a light feel, this is not the one for you. My best description of its texture is \"very dense\", but this is what makes it so filling.', u\"I was pleasantly surprised by how good these Pure bars are.  I've tried a number of healthy organic snack bars in the past, and most of them are barely edible.  These are a bit tart, but not overly so.  They are sweetened with dates & agave nectar, but are not overly sweet.  I wasn't sure if I liked the first bite, but they grow on you.I love the ingredients list, which is all whole food:  Dates, Cashews, Cherries, Rice Protein, Walnuts, Agave Nectar, Almonds...all organic.  This is an unprocessed, raw, healthy treat.  It contains 190 calories (70 from fat), 7g of protein, 3g of fiber, and 17g of sugars (which are natural fruit sugars).  It's also very low in sodium and high in potassium.My biggest complaint is that Amazon will only ship these to the Lower 48 states, so living in Alaska I can't order them.\", u\"I wasn't a big fan of this bar. I probably still have a taste for SAD diet foods though I've only been eating raw for a month. I didn't care for the texture and in my opinon there aren't nearly enough blueberries either. I love the texture of the blueberry Larabar and it tastes SO much better...to bad the Larabar isn't raw!\", u\"I was surprised- tasted pretty decent.  Even my picky 7-year-old allowed himself to be bribed into trying a couple bites.  If you like the ingredients, I think you'll find the taste sufficiently sweet enough and the consistency tolerable enough to keep buying them.\", u\"I rarely like snack bars but I eat them whenever I don't have time for a meal. These were great! One bar held me from lunch until dinner (6PM) with no problem. It tasted good - like blueberries and good granola. If they meet your nutritional requirements, then these are excellent, because they're delicious. Obviously, unless you are engaged in strenuous physical activity, you'll want to avoid eating too many because they are hi-carb and hi-cal. But, they are excellent for occassional meal replacement and would be awesome for breakfast.\", u'As part of the Amazon Vine program, I received a Cherry Cashew bar to sample and review. My normal breakfast routine consists of green tea and a Luna bar, so I was interested in comparing and possibly having a different alternative.The ingredients are good: it\\'s certified organic, gluten-free, has protein, Omega-3 added in, and it\\'s vegan. There is no gluten, dairy or soy for people who are allergic to those. Of course, there are cashews, which are frequently processed in plants with peanuts, so I\\'d recommend people with peanut allergies steer clear of this bar.It has slightly more calories (200) than a standard Luna bar, and 9 grams of fat. That seems a little excessive, even accounting for the cashews in the bar itself. There are 4 grams of fiber, which is decent. The other nutrients of measure in the bar itself are mostly minimal, which makes it hard to believe the claim that the bar contains a \"full serving of fruit\". It is low sodium, to boot.The flavor, as other reviewers have commented, was very much reminiscent of fruitcake - only a little more dry, and with nuts. If you are a fan of fruitcake, you might like this.', u'Bright, fresh flavors and they are pretty filling. Wish they had a variety pack with their other flavors as well.', u'I know it\\'s probably my fault for focusing on the \"blueberry\" vs. the \"nut\" on the label of the Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Fruit & Nut bar, but it definitely didn\\'t meet my expectations. The dominant flavor of this bar is of walnuts. They\\'re the third ingredient on the label after dates and cashews, but tastewise they take over. I only get the slightest taste of blueberry so I am quite disappointed. At 190 calories for the bar, they are about average for similar snacks and the ingredients list is all organic and raw. I wish I liked the flavor better.', u'I like this because you know its natural and tastes really good! Nice healthy snack for someone needing something to snack without going overboard.', u\"I'm splitting this review up into a few separate pieces:*Taste*I had the cherry cashew bar, and it's soft, thick, and chewy. Very similar to an odwalla bar if you've ever had one. It's very dense and heavy too compared to many similar products. It weighs 48 grams (compare that to say the 24 of quaker oat granola bar). The primary taste is definately cherry, with the cashews playing a secondary role mainly to provide some crunchyness.*health*190 calories isn't bad gives how much larger it is than most other similar products. It also has 7 g of protein whcih isn't bad. However it has 25 grams of net carbs, of which only 3 are fiber and 17 are sugar. If you're trying to watch carbs this may not be the products for you.*other*This thing is really trying to hit every intangible - it's organic, gluten free, vegan, kosher (certified by the OU), has no refined sugar, no trasn fats, no GMOs, no dairy, no soy, and no preservatives.\", u\"This individually wrapped organic snack bar with blueberries and other raw fruits and nuts is made with all natural ingredients. Two of the four people in my household said that they liked it well enough to purchase them.  I just thought that it was, okay.  Okay that is, if, you like eating a fruit-cake like snack. Personally, I'd rather eat a serving of fresh fruit and a handful of nuts.  However, this is a fairly good alternative when fresh isn't available.\", u'You can tell that they are good for you.  But they do a good job hiding the healthy.  The kids were good with the blueberry and banana.  Not a fan of the brownie and the dark choco cherry was just ok.', u'I was surprised to see \"rice protein\" I don\\'t know if it\\'s as bad as I think it is, but none the less, I didn\\'t like the bar at all. Three adults and one 3 year old split a bar. My adult daughter and I didn\\'t even finish our 1/4 of the bar. Only the 3 year old ate his. I\\'ve had other fruit and nut bars from Amazon and they were OK. I haven\\'t been crazy about any of them, but his one I actually didn\\'t like at all.', u'I really enjoy these. Great, intense flavor.. and nutritious.. just the right amounts of everything to give me a boost midday. I highly recommend.', u\"These aren't bad, but aren't my favorite snack bar.  I wasn't terribly impresses with the flavor or the texture.\", u'I have definitely had worse.  My wife said she would not eat another one.  If I was one a health kick this would be a nice afternoon snack.', u'I\\'m writing this just before I get another pack of PURE wild blueberry bars. I absolutely love them! They have a wonderful, deep intense flavor, very much like the best blueberry cobbler. To be honest, I had very low expectations when I first got them. Most of the time \"natural\" means \"tasteless cardboard\". But that was definitely not the case with these.My only \"problem\" was that they have 12g of sugar--which is due to the blueberries. I usually try to keep below 9g. But after tasting them, I think I\\'m going to make an exception for these. They work out wonderfully well as a mid-morning snack for me, since I eat breakfast at 6am and then don\\'t have a chance to get to lunch until around 1pm. It makes for a long morning without something other than black coffee to tide you over. These bars really hit the spot for me.I don\\'t know if I just got a fresh batch, but one of the other things that pleasantly surprised me was that the bars are not dried out. Mine were just moist enough to make you feel like you are eating a handful of fresh blueberries and nuts.Excellent!', u'On the wrapper under \"Yes\" it says it is \"certified organic\" (by Quality Assurance International-whoever they are and however they certified the organicness of the bar),\"glueten-free\" (which I know is a big concern for some people), \"a full serving of fruit\" (for those of you watching your servings on the food pyramid), made of \"organic protein,\"(hmmmmm) \"rich in Omega 3,\" (for those of you looking to improve your diet with unsaturated fat), \"good source of fiber\" (I\\'ll remaind silent on that one), \"raw\" (for the raw foodies), and \"vegan\" (I know you guys can have a hard time finding food).  However, on the wrapper under \"No\" it says no to \"glueten, dairy, soy,\" and under \"yes\" for vegans, yet on the label it says the food is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, and tree nuts.  Again hmmmmmmm.  At least they are up front about it by putting on label. I hope knowing this information helps people.This is the first time I have tried anything by Pure Organic.  I don\\'t eat fruit and nut bars very often, but if I do they are usually Quaker Chewy or Nature Valley.  This one doesn\\'t have much taste when you first bite into it, but as you chew the flavor of the cherries, cashews, walnuts, and dates comes out more.  I like the consistency of the bar.  The bar was free for me to review for Vine, but I would try it again in the future.', u'I\\'ve been giving several organic products a go lately, but is the first PURE Organic I\\'ve tried and I have to say it\\'s not selling me on the idea of trying more.Visually UnappealingI opened the package to see something that looked a lot like what I\\'d imagine beer dung to look like if it was flattened and chopped into a 3\"x2\" rectangle. Nuts and blueberries are visible through a brown paste, which has a slight sheen to it.Taste and TextureThe best part - you taste the nuts (walnuts, almonds and cashews) almost immediately. Actually I thought there was oats in it, but it\\'s all in the nuts. Texture is somewhat pasty and fibrous, but thankfully not dry.Lots of fiber (3g) which according to the label may contain \\'pieces of nuts, shells, stems or pits\\'.  Not reassuring, but definitely organic!Certified organic, this bar has rice protein and agave nectar, with a few other this and that thrown in, but very little.  It\\'s considered \\'raw, vegan, rich in omega-3\\'s, a full serving of fruit, certified organic and gluten-free\\'. Taste however, at least for me, it lacks.Overall, I liked the idea of it, and will give the makers kudos for putting all kinds of good stuff in there, but if you need to find a quick snack that\\'s under 200 calories and is gluten-free, consider a handful of raw almonds and a piece of fruit instead.  It would taste much better and probably cost the same or less.', u'These bars taste good, are healthy, have healthy ingredients, no soy, etc.  When I read the ingredient content, and the fact that they are vegan, I had to try it.  The bar is wholesome, raw, and really tastes good.  The bar has a slightly sticky texture, but that\\'s okay with me.  Even though I will not list the ingredients, they do look good and healthy!Only one thing that might bother \"true\" vegans:  this bar does not appear \"kosher\" as it is \"produced in a facility that processes milk, egg, fish, etc\".  But that doesn\\'t bother me, because that doesn\\'t mean the bars \"touch\" milk, eggs, or fish - those machines could be far away (in the other side of the building) from the machines that produce these bars.But these bars do taste good and are healthy - therefore, you do not have to be \"vegan\" to enjoy them.  Anybody can eat them.', u\"Sadly, that also goes for taste.  Sure, this is healthy.  If you are a health nut who views food as mere sustenance and doesn't look to eat things that taste good then by all means, dig in.  Personally though, I take my food a little more seriously.  I love to eat healthy (or at least I want to love to eat healthy) but I also require that my food taste good.I don't just want to feel full, I want to feel satisfied.PURE organic bars are full of organic goodness, but they don't do anything for my taste buds.  I'll say too that the consistency of the bar itself is not really that appetizing.  I've had fruit bars before, and they are rather gummy in texture and that isn't really appealing to me, and this bar is similar in texture.  For a `Wild Blueberry' bar too, I didn't get very much blueberry flavor.It was kind of bland.There are certainly better tasting bars out there that are healthy for you.  They may not be organic and they may not have `nothing' in them, but they at least have some flavor.There is a long list of no's on the back; they should have added `no taste' to the list.\", u\"Because I am a member of the Vine Program, I was sent only one bar of the Pure Bar Organize Wild Blueberry. The bar was quite small, and it didn't last for long. But it was delicious and really made me wish I had been sent a bigger sampling, maybe two or three bars. I liked the sample so much that I do intend to buy more of these bars.\", u\"The flavor was good, the texture was good and the ingredients were excellent. Another person described it well, fruitcake like smell and texture. I could only eat a half of a bar at a time which is weird. I LOVE fruit stuff but I just couldn't even force myself to eat the rest.\", u\"The wild blueberry flavor doesn't go well with rest of the fruits and nuts. It tastes a bit artificial and I will not purchase it again.\", u\"This is like a breakfast bar or power bar with a little bit of everything in it...and it's tasty and great! I normally grab a Kashi or Cascadian Farms granola bar first thing in the morning at around 120 calories. This bar was more filling and supplied more energy at 200 calories. I was put off by the calorie count at first but for a bigger punch of energy and fullness it's worth it. Very dense.I would definitely get these again.\", u'Talk about a treat --  this cherry cashew flavored bar was bursting with texture, tartness and a touch of sweet. A little pricey for me, but I will certainly buy these again. Oh -- and I was skeptical, for I generally do not love cashews.', u\"Taste:  The cherry flavor is good.  I didn't have any issues with the taste.  I didn't get any bad aftertastes and it wasn't a hard nut bar, so it would be easy for people with sensitive teeth to chew.  The cherry taste is one of those that is good once in a while, but it isn't a bar you'd want to eat every day.Cost:  We typically buy Clif Bars which cost about $1 each.  These bars on Amazon are about $1.50 each.  To me that's a big difference for a similar size bar.For me, the cost wins out over the flavor--which is just okay. I would only want one of these bars about once a week.  So, I would recommend buying one or two from a store near you, but not a whole box.\", u\"I like to have a bar to carry in my briefcase during the work day in case I have to eat a late lunch, need an afternoon snack, etc.  Most taste like one is eating a bunch of chemicals (which they usually are).  This one actually tasted like I could have made it at home.  It was chalk full of nuts with a strong blueberry taste coming through.  I knew what all the ingredients were and didn't need a chemistry degree to read them.  Best of all for me, as I have high blood pressure, was no sodium.  I will definitely be buying these again!\", u\"My favorite dried fruits are dried cherries.  So I was really kidding myself when I broke off a small piece of this bar just to taste it...thinking I'd finish it later.  NOT.  In addition to tasting great, nothing in this bar has been cooked, and all ingredients are organic. It's also gluten free and preservative free.I had planned to eat this bar with a cup of tea for lunch or a snack, but it ended up being dessert.  It's nice to have something taste this good without having to feel guilty about eating it.\", u\"I have to start off by saying this was not quite what I expected it to be.  I thought it would be super nutty, sort of trail-mix-in-a-bar type thing; I'm glad it wasn't!  The texture is a bit hard to describe, chewy and moist, not nutty but more like a solid bar of pureed fruit.  I remember thinking it was quite a bit like the inside of a Fig Newton, both in looks and texture, though maybe a bit chewier.  I didn't pick up on any particularly nutty flavors and didn't see any huge chunks of nuts in my bar, which I sort of liked because it seems like there are enough of those chunky, crunchy granola bars on the market.  I would pick up this bar if I saw it at the store and wanted to have something on hand that is quick to eat, yet filling enough to last for a few hours, and isn't packed full of preservatives and chemical ingredients that I can't pronounce.\", u\"let's make it clear that most of these energy bars are pasty and/or hard, i.e. don't expect a snickers bar. also, like those bars, it's not a low-calorie, low-sugar, low-fat bar, okay? it's for quick energy.that being said, this bar doesn't taste any worse than powerbars or other similar products, though it lacks the crunch of others. imagine this like a really, really thick fruit leather that's a bit heartier than you're used to.the flavor is quite fruity, and the cherry does come through. there are only 7 ingredients in this thing. and the only extra sweetener agave nectar which is the 6th ingredient listed. HOWEVER, the bar is still very sweet because the first ingredient is dates, so there are 17 grams of sugar, but they're natural fruit sugars. due to dates' high glycemic index, this would not be recommended for diabetics, though if you're a diabetic, you shouldn't consume any of these energy bars.overall, assuming that it doesn't deviate from how energy bars are supposed to be, it's delicious. and i like that there's a raw, organic alternative, so it's also not very processed at all. my toddler and i ate this thing up after the free sample from amazon arrived - i realize why the vine program can increase revenue because i'm gonna have to buy more of these on my own... thanks for suckering me in.\", u\"I'm not a huge fan of the energy bar craze, but I've also yet to find one that really tasted like food.  Granted this is a personal preference, but I also have time, I guess, to eat least grab a quick meal, rather than working right through lunch every day.  Even on those days, I can still eat at my desk while working.  Be that as it may, the energy bar thing has never really made sense to me, nor had I found any that tasted decent.Pure, however, has made a couple that actually taste like food, instead or sugary chemicals.  The Cherry Cashew flavored bar, specifically, actually tastes like cherries and cashews (imagine that!).  I was surprised by the flavors, namely the actual ones listed on the label, along with the near complete lack of artificial or chemical flavors.  As for the texture, it's not dissimilar from other like products; it's a cross between a brownie and a caramel bar, chewy, but firm.  Overall, a darn fine product.I'm not about to start eating power/energy bars every day now in place of meals or just whenever, but I will say that if I had to choose one, this would be it.  The two flavors I have tried (blueberry being the other) really impressed me.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking to try something new in the genre.\", u'These all organic bars feature nuts, blueberries juices, fruit concentrate, agave nectar and very little else.  Raw as well as organic, they contain 190 calories and provide a nice punch of blueberry flavor.  Unlike many bars of this type they did not have that \"earthy\", bitter aftertaste and are not overly sticky.I am always on the look out for healthy snacks that can travel. With hot weather approaching, packing food  and leaving it in the car is not appealing.  Fast food is unhealthy and expensive and most bars are deceptively unhealthy and don\\'t really taste good.  (Really for two hundred calories you can have a snickers bar and be none the worse off!)I like the flavor and the natural ingredients. The portability is a plus and the nuts tend to hold your appetite at bay.  I will definitely carry these as a healthy on the road snack.', u\"Although I probably wouldn't make Pure Bars part of a daily splurge, I have to say this product is worthy of being part of an on-the-go, healthy-eating survival kit.  There's a lot of goodness packed into the 1.7 ounce bar.  Of course, it weighs in at 190 calories, 70 of which are from fat, and 26 carbs, but you also get 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, not to mention the goodness that you'd get from a serving of raw fruit and raw nuts (which can be a little bit inconvenient to carry around in your bag when you're out and about.)  The Pure Bar is going to keep you feeling fuller longer than if you were to grab up a candy bar, plus, with the Pure Bar, you're not getting all that refined sugar, trans-fat, saturated fat, and guilt that is served up in a candy bar wrapper.Pure Bar is sweet enough to chase off a craving for sugar.  In fact, for something that's made of raw fruit and raw nuts, it's quite sweet, bordering a little bit on that kind of sweet that gets you in the back of the throat if you're not careful.  But taking smaller bites and chewing thoroughly helps with this, as opposed to biting off a quarter of the bar at once. The fruit flavor is very intense, and so are the flavors of each individual nut.  That really impressed me!  I could taste the walnuts and cashews, as opposed to seeing them in the bar and feeling them in my mouth, but otherwise having no taste experience of the nuts.  The bar itself has a good texture.  Not too wet, not too dry.My favorite use of Pure Bar would be on the go, when I couldn't take fruit or nuts with me, but knowing I could find myself away from the kitchen or anywhere with healthy snack options when hungry-time strikes.  It's a better choice than a candy bar, but me, personally, I wouldn't want to use this as an everyday stand-in for breakfast or lunch, simply because the Pure Bar still contains 190 calories, in a little bar-sized package that will be eaten up in under two minutes, even if one were to take smaller bites than the previously-mentioned quarter-of-the-bar-sized bites.  I'd think of it as emergency rations, or an occasional less-guilty treat than most other conveniently-packaged treats out there.\", u\"These Pure Bars are fantastic.  I love organic foods and these will be replacing my usual granola bars from now on.  They have a great taste, yet are the most attractive looking things(they resemble little squared blocks of mud).  The blueberry flavor is good, yet not overpowering.  These bars just taste healthy.  They're not heavy or greasy.  They're delicious.  They'll be a staple in my pantry from now on.\", u'Pure hypes this as \"Organic, Vegan, 4 grams of fiber...\" and so on for a long paragraph.  I don\\'t really care.  It looks like a candy bar or a snack bar and that\\'s how I\\'ll review it.It\\'s not disgusting.  I can taste the cherry.  It doesn\\'t have a noticeable aftertaste.  And that\\'s about it on the positive side.The negative side isn\\'t large.  The texture isn\\'t pleasant.  Although I could see the cashew chunks I didn\\'t notice any cashew flavor - and I like cashew so that was a disappointment.It\\'s nice to have the Omega 3s, vitamins and what not but I take supplements for those anyway and those aren\\'t mildly annoying to eat.Summing up, I have little use for this but it wasn\\'t bad enough to warrant a 1 star review.  However, if you\\'re heavily into the \"organic\" stuff this is worth looking at.', u\"This bar was pretty good, but I didn't like it as much as the PURE cranberry cashew bar. The problem was that the taste was a bit bland, and I really didn't get a lot of blueberry flavor. However, the nuts in the bar improved it.The bar has the consistency of the fig filling in a fig cookie; it is not reminiscent of cardboard like some other health bars. The ingredients are amazing, and the bar is satisfying.\", u'Although not too sweet and with a good fruit flavor and texture, this Pure Bar did not live up to its billing.  The name says Cherry Cashew.  However, the fruit flavor was largely of dates, which are the number one ingredient by weight.  The cashews in the bar are completely overwhelmed by the walnuts, and I could not detect any cashew tones.  If this had been labeled Date Walnut instead of Cherry Cashew the flavor would be matching expectations.', u'I gave this bar two stars instead of one because it did not make me sick.  However, it does not taste very good.  It has a sort of mealy consistency.  The cashew and cherry flavors come through.  It is not excessively sweet.  I ate one for breakfast and found it moderately filling.  The ingredients, of course, are excellent, but they are also found in actual food.There are so many good-tasting bars out there - such asLUNA: Nutz Over Chocolate Bar: 15 CountorAtkins Day Break Bars, Cranberry Almond, 1.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15), that this would not be the one I reach for on the grocery store shelf.  If I was starving to death, though, this bar would come in handy.', u\"When I opened the package I was a bit skeptical. The bar is rather small looking, and frankly not too visually appealing. The flavor however, is absolutely outstanding. The bar is dense and flavorful, packed with all kinds of nuts and fruits with the dominant flavors being cashews and tart cherries. I was pleased that the bar is not overly sweet, rather focusing on the nuts and the natural sugars from the fruit. The bar is actually quite filling too, and can easily act as a healthy snack that could replace a light lunch or breakfast. I will definitely be ordering more and trying the other flavors. It's like a bag of trail mix packed into a snack bar. Highly recommended!\", u\"Great tasting bar that is almost like eating the fig center of a newton for those unfamiliar and it's closest in comparison to taste would be the Larabars.  Of course much fruitier and combined with nuts for a very pleasing, healthful and nutritious snack with emphasis on no additives and organic if those things are important to you.\", u'This bar tasted better than I thought it would, and I like it slightly better than the PURE organic \\'Cherry Cashew\\'.  It is completely organic, gluten-free, with a full serving of daily fruit!, added protein (nuts), 3 grams of fiber (comparable to two slices of wheat bread), completely raw (which keeps more nutrients than anything cooked) and vegan.Even though they call it a Wild Blueberry bar, blueberries are only the FIFTH largest ingredient -which I thought was interesting.  The main four ingredients are Dates, Cashews, Walnuts, and Rice Protein Concentrate(so maybe they should have called it the Date Cashew bar?)  Regardless, the blueberry taste is definitely there.Just like with the Cherry Cashew bar, the caloric content is 190 calories, with decent fiber, and 7 grams of protein.  It is definitely a healthy alternative to a standard chocolate bar; your body will thank you, and you\\'ll feel better for it.As for taste, it was pretty good.  It was smaller than I expected, and was very compressed -the consistency was kind of like a hybrid fudge/granola bar, without the chocolate taste...Four stars because it doesn\\'t fail in any of the areas it was advertising.  (I.e. It doesn\\'t taste as \"good\" as a chocolate bar, but you weren\\'t buying it for that, but for a healthy snack that fits the bill.  It does.)  I guess I didn\\'t give it five stars because the main ingredient wasn\\'t as highlighted as it could have been.', u\"This cherry-cashew (and walnut and almond) bar is vegan, also containing organic rice protein and agave nectar -- and that's it.  It is 190 calories per 1.7 oz bar with 8 g fat and 0 trans fat.  The taste is very good, more cherry than nut, and the texture is chewy and a tiny bit gummy, in a pleasant way.  I enjoyed this and another family member liked it.  Would buy another.\", u\"I am always looking for products that I feel good about putting into my kids' school lunches - that they will actually eat.  This bar contains natural ingredients, mashed together into the bar, without a lot of ingredients added just for the convenience of the manufacturer.  Its fruit/nut base makes it sweet enough that kids will eat it but also provide them with some essential nutrients instead of empty calories.\", u\"These are really delicious. The texture reminded me a little bit of the original Power Bar, but not as hard or chewy. Great balance of fruit it nut, not too dry, and has a satisfying crunch. Loved the sweetness level--you taste the berry and the nut flavor w/out it being too sweet. Decent amout of fiber (3g) and protein(6g). When I was done, I felt like I had actually eaten something (not like some 'airy' bars) yet is wasn't too dense to be a chore to chew. The reason I gave a 4 rather than a 5 star was the price. It's pretty similar to other organic bars, but my budget will usually have to go non-organic, like the South Beach Protein Fit bars. Yet again, these are pretty yummy. I'd say, if you can afford these, then get them.\", u'Oh yeah.... I was surprised how good this tasted without alot of fake ingrediants in it.. this and the blueberry are really good and honestly satisfying.', u'These are good. Keep in mind you may perhaps need to slightly acquire a taste for them since we are so used to high sugar content.  But give them a chance.  Great snack.  I am going to try a couple other flavors....', u\"Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Bars are a good, raw, meal replacement bar (at about 190 calories per bar).  Like many raw bars, these bars are made from dried fruit and nuts, but unlike some other bars, this bar tasted mainly like the advertised fruit--blueberries--and not like nuts or other dried fruits.  The nut pieces are relatively small--so they provide protein not taste.  This bar was also sweeter than many other raw bars I've had (thanks to the inclusion of agave) so if you want something a bit sweet, this is a good choice.\", u\"I was just getting used to the blueberry flavor and thought I'd try another. If I was just after these bars for protein I wouldn't be ordering again. Amount of protein is not too high in comparison to sugar and calories. I bought then mostly for a high calorie snack, but added protein was a plus. But the blueberry ones left like a sandy texture in mouth towards the end of each bite. These didn't do that and these tasted like brownies and had texture of fudge brownies. Maybe I'm crazy or just deprived of brownies, but they aren't bad at all. Will buy again, but lay off of any other sugar in my diet.\", u\"These are my favorite healthy bar on the market today. The blueberry is my fave flavor. I have noticed that people who are used to a toxic fast food/microwave dinner/sugary cereal diet do not like these bars. Our taste buds get accustomed to the things we regularly eat. If you have a healthy diet and stay away from refined sugars, then you will probably enjoy them. I am celiac (gluten free), dairy free, and refined sugar-free. These bars save my life when I'm out and need a quick meal. They do contain the occasional small piece of nut shell in them, so chew slowly and thoroughly (something we should do anyway). I recommend these bars to all my healthy friends and I can't wait for this company to release even more awesome flavors.\", u'I was excited to try the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew- while I am not usually much of a cherry flavor fan and I\\'m more of an almond girl, I was looking forward to trying a new raw fruit and nut bar that wasn\\'t my usual larabar.The cherry is dried cherry and the little bits are incredibly tart yet sweet, like craisins (dried crankberries) only more juicy and less of a \"dry\" after feel...  While I don\\'t like cherry flavor, I do like fresh and dried natural cherries.  This bar did not disappoint. Tart, sour, lots of flavor...The cashews added a few little chunks to an otherwise \"soft\" bar... I think I would have preferred the texture if it picked either a soft, chewy, smooth consistency or a trail-mix chunky bar, as the little bits of cashew in the otherwise soft bar just were not appealing to me.Nutritionally, I liked the breakdown as I am a Type 1 Diabetic and I am always looking for a good snack to toss in my bag, just in case my sugar starts dropping.  Typically I either treat a low or prevent one by grabbing a meal... Having a bar with fair amounts of protein and fat AND dried fruit is perfect as the dried fruit affects my blood sugar much faster than the protein (but still not so fast, in this bar, that I would use this as a low blood sugar/hypoglycemia treatment), then the protein kicks in.  As a meal replacement, in a pinch, this is great.  I plan on buying more and stashing them in this year\\'s hurricane kit.', u'There is simply nothing bad about these bars - they taste fantastic and are made of wholesome ingredients.', u\"Except for the actual shape, I think these are almost exactly the taste and texture of Lara Bars. They are organic, which I don't think Lara Bars are, but they are made out of whole, raw foods like cashews and other nuts. They get their sweetness from things like dates. Overall, I like them, but am not wowed by them. Personally I am more of a chocolate fan...\", u'I\\'m trying my first bar of PURE Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar as I type this. The package contains all vital information including ingredients, and a list of all the positive things it has in it (rich in Omega 3\\'s, etc.) as well as a list of what it does not have (like gluten, diary, soy, transfats, etc.).  The bar itself is dark brown and fairly soft. As I bite into it, the texture is pleasing and right away I can see a few small bits of nuts and dates.  The taste is pleasing, with tart cherries balancing the taste of dates.  Fortuantely, there is no \"sawdust\" feel as I swallow, just a bit of grainyness that you might expect from a healthy raw fruit and nut bar.  All in all, a very pleasant and tasty experience.', u'I decided to try the Wild Blueberry Pure Organic Raw Fruit & Nut Bar after trying the Cherry Cashew version and liking it but finding the \"cherry\" flavor to be very subtle.  In addition to being Certified Organic, this bar is gluten-free and vegan. Furthermore, the Wild Blueberry flavor contains a full serving of fruit, is a good source of fiber (3 grams), and provides Omega-3s as well. There is also a decent amount of protein (6 grams, slightly less than the Cherry Cashew bar), and although the amount of sugar is higher than I would\\'ve liked (19 grams, or almost 4 teaspoons), the bar is naturally sweetened using agave nectar only, with no other added sugars added.The bar was thick and dense in appearance, with an almost slightly sticky feel. The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.  Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list).  The bar also did have a nutty flavor, and in fact it contains cashews, walnuts, and almonds.  Overall, I liked the taste (I like dates!), but I thought the \"Wild Blueberry\" label was deceiving, and I definitely have had other bars that I prefer.In the end, I liked the Cherry Cashew Pure Bar a bit more than this one, and I would rate the nutritional profile of that flavor as slightly better as well. Although these bars are not perfect, I would definitely recommend them to someone with specific dietary needs, such as vegan or gluten-free.', u'Another natural, organic, date-based bar, these are sweet, chock full of nuts and delicious. The overall blueberry flavor is there but it is not overpowering - you still enjoy the taste of cashews, walnuts, almonds, etc.  They\\'re not light and crispy like trashy \"energy bars,\" instead they are pleasantly dense and chewy, but not heavy. Great for an in-between-meals snack, and I will also take these on hikes and long walks. The bar is small, you could easily enjoy a couple of these at a time.', u'I was pleasantly surprised by this product and have subsequently ordered all other flavors! The blueberry bar has just enough sweetness to make it taste like a treat. no way would I have imagined these were raw and actually good for you. The bars are dense and moist, much better than the dry, crunchy, tasteless varieties of most nutrition bars. They are a bit small but the size is deceiving. They are very filling and give me the energy I need as either a breakfast substitute or as a pick me up in the afternoon. I appreciate the 6 gms of protein and 3 or so gms of fiber. While they do have a high fat content it comes purely from healthy sources such as the nuts in the various varieties. There is absolutely no sugar or flour in these, and since I do have a wheat food allergy and watch my sugar intake, I am thrilled to finely have a product I can enjoy eating without facing the consequences later. Worth every penny and more.', u'I am always on the hunt for something that I can keep with me or use as a breakfast-type item...I am just not a person likes to sit down and eat a full breakfast. So, when I got the chance to try the Wild Blueberry flavor of the PURE Organic Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, I figured I may as well.I have tasted some absolutely hideous bars, and I have had some that I quite enjoy. This was sort of in the middle - the flavor was a bit on the bland side, though certainly not horrid. There was a hint of sweetness, and it did fill me up for a bit (I ate it as a mid-morning snack, and it kept me OK until about lunchtime.). It\\'s healthy enough, though it could be trouble for people with allergies...the allergy statement says \"Contains cashews, walnuts, almonds. This product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, tree nuts.\".Long story short - if I was given one, I would eat it. If they were on sale, I may buy them. For full price, I prefer the Lara Bars - particularly with the ability to purchase them at Costco. They just seem to have more flavor.', u'Unlike some other reviewers, I do not normally eat a lot of protein bars and the like. I have had a few and found this bar to be much sweeter and tastier than the others, which mostly taste like cardboard with sugar on top. This was very chewy and had a lot of cherry flavors. It tasted fresh and was surprisingly filling for such a small bar. It is definitely an above-average bar. I feel like it is made of \"good stuff,\" but the calorie count is a bit high (200). That said, it will cure a sweets craving without nearly as much impact as a candy bar, plus it\\'s just better for you in all respects.', u\"The first thing I noticed unwrapping the bar was how unappetizing it appeared, but how glamorous can an energy bar really get, right? Seriously though, try to get past the appearance.The texture is pretty typical for an energy bar - chewy, but not as tough as a PowerBar, for example. I don't believe PowerBar makes blueberry bars, so that's one reason to choose Pure. I've noticed comparisons to the filling of theFig Newton(a delicious cookie I might add!), and I'd agree that's accurate. The blueberry flavor is not that prominent, however. I wanted to taste more blueberries, but having more than one bar at a time isn't a healthy choice. Each bar contains 8 grams of fat and 19 grams of sugar.Overall a good balance of fruit, nuts, and texture, but be prepared for lackluster taste.*EDIT November 10, 2011*I'm actually beginning to enjoy these more. I can't have dairy products, which many energy bars usually contain, but the Pure bars are free of dairy, so I have to acknowledge it. I've been trying different flavors and bringing them while hiking or out and about, and they give me a boost when I really need a snack. I appreciate these much more than I once did.\", u'If you insist on organic food, then this may fill the need for a snack bar. The cherry cashew one I had tasted good enough. In sum, not too sweet, easy to chew, the nuts overwhelmed the cherries, but the cherries I did detect had a distinctly cherry taste. It has 190 calories, a low amount of fat and low levels of minerals and vitamins. The ingredients were simple and obvious except for the \"organic rice protein concentrate.\" I can\\'t say the taste alone would lead me to seek them out and buy them, but if you are searching for organic foods, this is worth a try.', u\"I honestly enjoyed eating this.  The texture was much heavier and denser than I was expecting.  That's not really a bad thing, I was just surprised.  It has some chunks of nuts in it (obviously this isn't good for people with nut allergies, but I think the 'fruit and nut bar' part of the name would have tipped those people off.  To me, the flavor is nicely sweet.  Most of what I eat isn't sweetened very heavily, so it may be that people who are more used to drinking soda and eating sweeter foods would find it under-sweetened.  For me it was just pleasant without being too sweet.I had it as a snack and I think it was just a little too heavy for that in my case.  I'm used to eating pretty light snacks.  I think the next time I have one of these, I'll have to treat it more as belonging in the 'meal replacement' bar category, rather than the 'snack bar' category.  For people used to heavier snacks, your mileage will definitely vary.I like this a lot for the fact that it tastes good, it travels well, and there's nothing in it that you need to feel too bad about eating.  There is a fair bit of fat, but anything that contains chunks of nuts is going to have some fat (and just speaking for myself, I'm prone to have days when I don't eat enough fat, so it's actually probably a good thing for me).  I would've ideally liked for it to have a little bit more fiber, but it's not too bad in that area.The flavor that I tried was the Wild Blueberry and I could definitely taste the blueberry flavor in it, though it wasn't overwhelming at all.  I like blueberries, but it's not usually my favorite flavor in this kind of thing (the company offered me a blueberry flavored bar as an item to try and review).  I'm rating this partly based on the fact that I'm a little lukewarm on blueberry flavored things in general, and I still really liked this.  I have a feeling that if I try out one of the flavors that are a little closer to my normal tastes, these could very easily become my 'go to' option for carrying around in case I find myself feeling like I need something to eat away from home.\", u\"Outstanding taste! Having been a connoisseur of various health/nutrition bars, trying nearly everything on the market, I have to say I have never tasted anything this good with this amount of nutrition. The cherry taste is distinct, and coupled with the more subtle cashew flavor the result is absolute nutritious heaven. The texture is satisfyingly chewy, and it's very filling for a healthy snack.I will most definitely buy these at the grocery store, and recommend them highly.\", u\"Of course, what different people like in food is a matter of ... well ... taste.  But I for one did not like this bar.  I found it tart and unnatural tasting, nothing like the cherry flavor that I was expecting (it didn't taste like real cherries, marachino cherries, or the fake cherry flavor that so many candies come in, it just tasted like a mixed berry type of bar with all the sweetness sucked out by the preserving process).  It was chewy and stuck in my teeth (not what I was expecting either).  And the nuts were mushy (probably because of the fruit).  I had given half to my daughter (4 years old) and started on the other half.  She liked it so I gave her the rest of mine after a few bites.  But even she was just okay with it, not wanting to throw it away but also not gobbling it down like she does with most granola bars and fruit bars.  I do not recommend this bar for taste at all.On the health side, it does have a lot of healthy ingredients (if you can overlook the few chemicals thrown in to preserve and improve taste).  And it wasn't high in calories like many bars are.  I wouldn't overlook this if you are the type of person who wants to eat healthy on the go and doesn't mind the taste (my father in law probably would have liked it, his food is often very bland and unappealing but he eats for health only).\", u\"This fruit and nut bar has an impressive list of health-conscious features: gluten-free, no artificial ingredients, no refined sugar, organic, high in Omega-3, vegan-friendly, and so on.  None of that would matter to me if it tasted like cardboard.  Well, guess what? It's delicious!  It's chewy fruit and crunchy nuts and not much else, with a rich cherry flavor, mixed in with cashews, walnuts, dates and almonds.  The only downside is it's 190 calories, rather high for a snack bar, with 8 grams of fat (0.5 saturated, 0 trans).  It's not really high in vitamins and minerals but it does have 7 grams of protein and only 5 of sodium.  On balance, it's a satisfying, tasty and healthful snack.\", u'I tend to prefer crunchy, rather than \"moist\" granola/snack/power bars. Most of the latter are too sticky for my liking. Additionally, most of the moist power bars are just too dense for my taste. The PURE Bar is a bit different. It is moist, but not too sticky or dense. The flavor is primarily of dates, but the fruit and nuts come through. As others have noted, it is a bit small for the calories it packs. Organic, raw, and vegan are nice bonuses. I\\'d buy this.', u\"I wasn't sure what to expect when I opened the packaging for this bar. I don't actively look for organic food (though I appreciate the concept). I'm mainly looking for something that tastes good, is nutritional, and is not too expensive.Visually, it's a small  dense bar. It's about 3  inches in length, less than  inch in height. I can see large chunks of nuts and there are a lot of blueberries in the bar. When you open the bar, you immediately smell blueberries. It's probably not the most attractive of snack bars, but to be honest, that's not important to me.Taste-wise, I liked it. It's sweet but there's no aftertaste. It's a bit chewy (which I would expect considering the ingredients) with the crunch of nuts. Overall I found it to be a very tasty bar which I can see eating for a mid-morning or afternoon snack.Nutritionally, this bar has 8g of fat, no trans fat, and  3g of fiber (12% DV), which is described as high fiber (in the Amazon description) but that doesn't seem all that high to me (the bar is more honest as describing it as a good source of fiber).Looking over the ingredients everything is listed as organic, with nothing cooked, or processed. Ingredients are listed in this order: Cashews, Walnuts, Rice Protein Concentrate, Wild Blueberries (with Apple Juice Concentrate and Sunflower Oil), Agave Nectar, Almonds, Lemon Juice Concentrate, and Blueberry Flavoring. For a blueberry bar, I wish that the blueberry ingredients were listed higher.Overall, I think these bars would appeal to someone who's interested in organic food or someone who's looking for a gluten-free, raw snack that's also tasty. Of course, organic unfortunately does mean more pricey. At more than $1.50 a bar, these are not inexpensive.\", u'I tasted this before reading the package and was blown away. \"Why does this taste so good?\" I wondered. I\\'d been expecting the usual generic breakfast bar type of taste. This was . . . alive! When I read the ingredients it all made sense to me. Raw fruit and nuts, everything organic. There are so many products out there that pretend to be healthy and turn out not to be, this one is the real deal. Like the label says, nothing cooked, nothing processsed, completely pure. I want more.', u'This bar has a nice dried cherry flavor, supplemented by cashew.  And I like that it is made of just dried fruits, nuts, agave syrup, and \"organic rice protein concentrate\" (whatever that is).The bar itself is smaller that I expected:  3-1/8 by 1-5/8 inches by 7/16 inch thick.  Out of 170 calories, only 7 grams  are protein.  Thus, it is mostly a carby bar, with 25g of carbs, 17g of which are sugar, and 8g of fat.If you prefer raw foods, this bar is probably useful to you. Otherwise there are probably better nutritional alternatives you may prefer that have more protein. Overall, with 190 calories (70 fat), it is hardly a meal substitute, but it may be a useful snack.Also, I do wonder about food safety.  Since it uncooked, how do they make sure there is nothing growing in it once manufacturered?  It has a \"Best By\" date 9 months from now, how can something unpreserved by heat just sit there without anything growing in it or without oils going rancid?', u\"Right out of the wrapper, this bar doesn't exactly appear appetizing.  Taking a bite of it, though, I found it to be pretty good.  This is definitely not a good snack for anyone with nut allergies, as it's studded with nuts.  If you're not allergic, it may make for a nice snack, if you are not bothered by the following.First off, the primary flavor of this bar comes from the ground dates.  While I could taste the blueberry in it, it was more something that would sneak up on me every few bites or so.  Mostly, it tasted like I was eating a ground date bar.  The nuts provide a nice crunchy contrast but, like the blueberries, I only encountered them every couple of bites.  If you're a big fan of dates, you would likely really enjoy this bar.  If you don't like dates, this is definitely not for you.The thing that really held me back from truly liking the bar, though, was the texture of it.  I liked the crunch of the nuts, but the bar has a very grainy texture, which is also a result of its being mostly dates.  With each bite I took, I liked the flavor and really wanted to like the bar, but I just couldn't get past the texture.  I like the concept of it, but I think it would have tasted better if it had fewer dates and more grains, giving it more of a granola bar texture.\", u\"At first taste this has a great blueberry flavor.  I thought I was _really_ going to enjoy this bar.  As I continued to eat it I could taste the blueberry flavor less and less.  Perhaps this is because the flavor is the same all through the bar; I'm not sure.  I liked it; it has an authentic blueberry flavor but it didn't wow me.  If you are looking for a good and healthy blueberry bar this will do.  It isn't overly sweet either.  If you want amazing or multiple flavors this isn't quite it.  If you want good, healthy and raw this will work great.\", u'The footprint for fruity, protein, energy pseudo-health bars continues to grow. New in 2009 is \"Pure of Holland\"\\'s Organic Cherry Cashew Bar. As \"Pure of Holland\" states on it\\'s website, Pure Organic Cherry Bar may be \"Way too good to be this good\". What are the positives? The ingredients include organic dates, cherries, walnuts, cashews, brown rice protein, vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants, healthy Omega 3, and it has 2% Niacin, which promotes good cholesterol! And it has o% trans fat. The negatives are total carbs of 25 grams(high), 17 grams of sugar, 200 calories, and 80 Fat Calories. Dr. Atkins got \\'em beat there. What\\'s to worry? What about the taste? Do you like cherries?', u\"The taste of the bar was good.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Had a nice blend of fruit and nut tastes to it.  What I didn't really care for it is the texture.  I found it to be too wet and sticky for my liking.  It is on par with a power bar, but I don't care for those either because of the texture.What also stuck me as odd is that besides having the standard warning that it is produced in a factory that handles nuts, fish and other allergens, there is a warning that it may contain stems and pieces of shell. Really? Ummmm, no thanks. I'll take my bar without foreign objects please.  Just the fruit and nuts please.  I suppose I am missing the point that the bar is raw food.End of the day - it was a tastey little bar.  I think I will stick with my clif bars though.  Equally yummy and they don't tell me that there might be sticks in there. Maybe I should give Pure Bar credit for honesty.\", u'I\\'m not an expert on fruit and nut bars or energy bars, but I have eaten a fair number of them over time.  With that preface, I like this bar.  It has a nice consistency, chewy with plenty of nuts.  It has a smooth blueberry flavor surrounding the various nut flavors.  The texture is pleasing.  I thought it was particularly good with coffee.I also thought the ingredients and nutritional data listed on the wrapper looked appealing.  Essentially every ingredient is labeled organic and the fat types are, I believe, \"better\" fats.  I wouldn\\'t mind if calories were lower, but I don\\'t think they\\'re out of line for this type product.', u\"I had one Organic Pure bar so I gave half to my husband. Once I took a bite I wanted to get the other half back. I have to say this is really a tasty snack... You can taste the fruits (dates, cherries) and nuts (walnuts, cashews, almonds). This bar even has agave nectar. It's raw and pure... And it's Gluten free!  It's definitely one power / snack bar we will be buying... Highly Recommended.\", u\"If your not looking for an artificially sweetned snack bar than this will do. It's like a much softer, much thicker fruit roll up. It is all organic, there's not a single ingredient that you've never heard of. And I for one (an average fruit lover) loved this bar. This is the first amazon.vine food product that I will buy after trying. The closest thing to this I can remember eating was something a friend of mine brought back from Armenia that was just dried and compressed fruit. This is much softer but just as natural.\", u'I enjoyed this.  I thought it tasted better than Cliff bar, and since it serves the same purpose as Cliff, I would choose this one if I had to pick between the two.  I especially enjoyed the crunchy nuts.', u\"I've eaten dozens of different food bars over the years.  I mainly eat them at work when I can't easily make something because they are very easy to bring along and have when I'm hungry.  I like how these bars taste and I also like that all of the ingredients are not only organic, but also good for you.  The consistency is somewhat like a banana with nuts in it, so this is not a very hard bar, but the nuts to give it a little crunchiness which is nice.  There is also a decent amount of protein in fiber which I like to have in the bars I eat.  All-in-all this bar will likely stay in my rotation at least until I get tired of it or find something I like better.\", u'I\\'m not sure how one is supposed to approach food reviews, but this is rather simple. All of these \"organic/vegan/all natural\" bars all wind up tasting the same. The primary ingredient is always dates, because they\\'re the only filler material that apparently works. This isn\\'t to say that the bars are bad, though they start out okay and taste like their namesake, but eventually the blueberry taste vanishes into the void to be totally replaced by the flavor of dates and the occasional walnut. This isn\\'t a coke v pepsi issue either, preferring one to the other. This is a pepsi vs. pepsi vs. pepsi problem. The only ones that break the mold are those that cram in enough spices to leave you coughing dust.Basically, if you like dates and nuts and you want something small for an brief energy bump, these work. The challenge is finding the particular variety that you prefer, and best of luck in that endeavor.', u'This product is above average in taste, quality and edibility. Though I only received one bar for review it was very satisfying indeed. It has a rich fruity taste where you can taste the Cashews and Cherry and it was very satisfying compared to some of the bland products I have tried over the years.I will be keen to try some more of these!', u\"The bar is healthy judging from the ingredients. I was looking forward to getting it because I love cherries and cashews.  And, I'm always looking for a good health bar.  But, I was disappointed when I tried it. In fact, no one in my family (two daughters and wife) really enjoyed it.  It's rather dry and not very appealing.\", u'This is a wholesome equivalent to the various power & breakfast bars being offered.  The ingredients are quite impeccable - and the flavor quite good.  Both kids (8&9) enjoyed this bars, and ate them without protest..', u\"I am pretty experienced with energy / breakfast bars. I bike to work and often pack an energy bar as a quick breakfast or midday snack, and also used to eat them for supplemental protein or as meal replacements... suffice it to say I've tried numerous flavors and varieties of Powerbar, Clif Bars, Balance, South Beach, Quaker Oats, Nutri-Grain, Luna, etc.I got this bar as a free sample (Cherry Cashew flavor) and have to say I'm pretty impressed. I normally don't worry too much about getting 'organic' or 'vegan' food... I love meat, and I love saving $, so I tend to choose cheaper 'normal' stuff over the vastly more expensive vegan / organic alternatives, and this extends to my energy bars. However, after trying this Pure Bar, I may actually consider buying some next time I'm at the store.First thing that struck me was how soft & moist the bar is. At room temperature, it's not dry like most breakfast bars, nor is it as chewy / hard as many energy bars. Instead, it had the texture and consistency of maybe a dense fruitcake? Flavor was nice. Not too strong, not any hint of that weird protein taste, not too sugary... pleasant (in my opinion). I ended up wolfing it down and then checked the nutrition info on the back.This bar isn't going to fill your daily fiber requirement, nor is it going to satisfy a bodybuilder's protein requirement, but I found the nutritional value to be very well balanced and healthful. Lots of vitamins, 12% of your fiber, low carbs (compared to many other energy / breakfast bars), a decent amount of protein (7g, again nothing crazy but also better than most sweetsy breakfast bars), low fat... plus, whether you're a vegan or not, you can't really knock it for being organic and made with all vegan ingredients.I really do believe I will begin buying this bar as an alternative to fruit when I need a quick breakfast or energy on the go. This is probably great for kids, too... as a snack or as a lunchbox stuffer. Only drawback is the $1.50 pricetag per bar, but that's not so bad considering the high prices for other similar organic / vegan energy bars. Aside from wishing the bars were a little cheaper, I definitely recommend them.\", u'This is advertised as a Pure Organic, and as such, and as expected, this has a natural, raw, earthy taste - it\\'s probably the blend of nuts, dates and the other organics included. It is sweet without being overpoweringly sweet (at least for people who like sweets).You do get the snack satisfaction, without the unhealthy-food guilt :) But this is not calorie-free, one Pure bar (one serving) is 190 calories. The very welcome surprise for health-conscious snackers is the big zero, 0mg of sodium!Other nutritional positives, 6g of protein and 3g of fiber. There are traces of various nutrients (0% to 6% of various vitamins and minerals) so don\\'t throw the basket of fresh fruit away :-)The trade-off, as usual, with healthy foods, is price vs \"healthiness\". Where do you draw the line? (I do not have the answer I\\'m afraid).', u\"Before I get too much into my praises for this tasty little snack bar, let me begin by noting the allergy info for those contemplating a purchase.  This bar is loaded with nuts, specifically cashews, walnuts and almonds.  It is also produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, peanuts, fish, tree nuts and wheat.That said, it's a delicious and refreshing snack, and I say that as a certified, devout junk-food junkie.  Each bar has 190 calories (70 from fat) and a full serving of fruit for the day, as well as omega-3s and fiber.  It's organic, raw and vegan. And gluten-free, because the packaging notes that the PURE company is a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I wasn't sure how I'd like the taste, given all the foregoing, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's just sweet enough, the blueberries aren't overpowering, and it has a nice balance of chewiness and crunchiness.  It is expensive as snacks go, but all the money's right there in the munchie little bar.Yum!\", u'A great snack that has a good blueberry flavor and has healthy ingredients. A great on-the-go snack.', u\"This is a pretty good bar.  With 190 calories (70 cal fat), 25g carbs, it is in line with a lot of the bars advertised as healthy.  It is a bit sweet, in my opinion (dates, agave), but i think most people would find the sweet/ tart (cherries) mix well-balanced.  i don't love dates, so i'm on the fence about buying this again, but if dates is your thing, it is the first ingredient.  all the ingredients are food- understandable in english, organic, and uncooked.  this is my first time experiencing a Pure Bar, and i'd feel pretty good about giving my kids this as a snack.  i gave it 4 stars because the flavor is....just not quite what i think is delish, although pleasant enough.\", u'While the taste of these bars was OK, the texture left a lot to be desired.  I much rather prefer a baked like product, not one that is just pressure formed together.', u\"If you're looking for a snack that's a lot better for you than a candy bar, this might be a good option for you.  I enjoyed the blueberry & nut flavors, although the date taste is a touch more pronounced than I'd care for in a perfect world.  Still, I enjoyed these.  The bars are very moist, which I liked.  The price isn't bad, but frankly could be better.If you are looking for a tasty gluten free product, this is one to consider.  While I personally don't have a problem with gluten, I have tried a number of gluten free foods and most of them don't taste so good.  This bar has a nice flavor and solid nutritional statistics.I'd say that if you aren't sure, give it a try.  I enjoyed them.\", u\"The Pure Bar is healthier than most other bars or snacks on the market. I chose the cherry flavored bar. The cherry flavor was not very prominent, but it still had a good taste. The bar was a little dense but yet somewhat light. It also a little crunchy from the nuts. It had just a little sweetness from the fruit, but was not sugary.The nutrition facts from the package states:Ingredients:Organic datesOrganic cashewsOrganic CherriesOrganic rice protein concentrateOrganic walnutsOrganic agave nectarOrganic almondsand that's all, nothing cooked, nothing processed, completely PURE.Nutrition facts:Serving size: 1 bar (48g)Calories: 190, Calories from fat: 70Total fat: 8g,  12% Daily Value (DV)Saturated fat: 0.5g  3% DVTrans fat: 0gCholesterol: 0mgSodium: 5mg  0% DVPotassium: 220mg  6% DVTotal Carbohydrate 25g  8% DVFiber: 3g  12% DVSugars: 17g (from natural fruit sugars)Protein: 7gVitamin A 0% DVVitamin C 6% DVCalcium 4% DVIron 4% DVVitamin E 0%Thiamin 2% DVRiboflavin 2% DVNiacin 2% DVVitamin B6 2% DVFolate 2% DVPhosphorus 4% DVMagnesium 6% DVZinc 2% DVCopper 6% DVPercent of daily values (DV) based on a 2,000 calorie dietCertified Organic by QAINo refined sugarsNo gluten, dairy, or soyNo cholesterolNo trans fatsNo preservativesNo GMOsNo artificial nothin'Organic proteinRich in Omega-3sGood source of fiberRawVegan*May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.\", u\"Pure bars have a dense, oily consistency, similar to fruitcake.  I'm not crazy about the taste, though they would be great to have on hand when hiking or when in need of an energy boost.  The ingredients are healthy, but 190 calories is a little on the high side for my mid-day snack.  I would probably not buy these...I would rather eat fruitcake.\", u'I\\'m from Oregon and we grow a lot of blueberries in this state. This tastes to me like imitation blueberries (it includes \"organic blueberry flavor\"). It\\'s got great ingredients, but the flavor didn\\'t trill me.On the other hand, I love the PURE \"Cherry Cashew\" bar...it is yummy!One word of caution: This product is certified gluten free and a proud supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation, but if you look closely there is small letters that say it is produced in a facility that processes wheat!', u\"My family takes a lot of fruit and granola bars for snacks. My husband is a teacher and carries a couple in his briefcase for when he needs a quick pick me up and both kids take one for a morning snack. We all like chewy bars so this seemed right up our alley.The flavor was pretty good. If you are looking for a chewy snack though, this might not be your thing. The fruit bits were chewy enough but the rest of the bar was like a soft cookie.What turns me off entirely to this product is the price. For what's listed as the normal price, I would expect to pay for a power bar that is about twice the size of this healthy snack.I'm afraid my family is going to be staying with standard granola bars for now. While they may not boast all the nutrition of Pure Bar Organic snacks they are a lot more affordable when you are going through 12 of them a week.\", u'Our family often eats granola bars, especially ones that are high in fiber. I was happy to give this little bar a try. While cherry is not my favorite flavor, I kept an open mind when trying this bar. I do really love cashews, so I thought the combination might be interesting and tasty.  My husband an I both had a bite, and we both agreed it was too thick. It was not an enjoyable texture or flavor (even for my husband, who is a cherry fan). The cashew flavor was very subtle.  If you are a huge fan of cherry flavored bars, you may want to give this one a try. Unfortunately, for our family, we will not be trying it again.', u\"i have to say, i am not a big fan of cereal, snack or power bars.  they usually taste like vitamins or something but these had a lot of flavor.  they had the texture of fig newtons, sort of.they had a very rich taste of cherry and i ate them in the afternoon at my office.i also tried them 2 days for breakfast with coffee and orange juice and it really filled me up.actually, if i did that for about a month, i would probably lose weight.them being organic was nice even though i am not really into that kind of stuff.i have one in my purse just for emergencies.  i really liked them and if i saw them in the store, i would buy a box or two.they were that good.  they were soft and not chewy and they didnt' crumble all over the place when you opened them, like some cereal bars.this is a good buy and if you are looking for a middle of the day snack or a breakfast on the run item, this is it.\", u\"...and have to say, it is about as good as fruit and nuts smashed into a bar can get. Having succumbed to the urge to say that, the price is high, even for an organic- and ingredient-pure snack. I keep trying these kinds of bars thinking one just might have some real texture and some flavor other than sweet and sweeter.On a more positive note, I hope the Pure Organic people keep at it. They're on the right track. I loved the ingredient list, that nothing in the bars is processed (other than being ground and how else would one make nuts and fruits into a bar!), that the makers support the celiac Disease Foundation, and that they are made in the USA.Will I buy them to eat again. Sure. When I travel. But I still hope Pure Organic will keep at it. Those bars aren't what one could call delectable yet. Maybe I'm hoping for miracles.\", u'This is a product review for those of you that don\\'t regularly eat health bars and are looking for one to try.The nitty gritty of the ingredients per the manufacturer: Organic; Raw; Gluten-Free; Certified Kosher; Certified Vegan; Healthy; Delightful. Natural Food Certified. Eat pure--live pure. 400 mg Omega 3. Low sodium. 4 g Organic fiber. 1-1/2 serving fruit. No artificial nothin\\': no refined sugar; no preservatives,; no trans fats; no cholesterol; no dairy; no GMO\\'s; no gluten; and no soy. All-natural product. Natural fruit sugars. 15 Essential vitamins and minerals, antioxidantsNow to the taste test: The first taste was great, I really liked it, but then I got a bit of an aftertaste in my mouth. I finished the bar, and the taste was fine, but the aftertaste did not go away. Whether it is just part of the \"healthy\" ingredients or what I don\\'t know. If you are pretty picky on taste these might not be for you. I am someone that just can\\'t stand the aftertaste of diet sodas, and am not too much into health bars because of their taste.I imagine those people who eat health bars regularly might enjoy the taste more.', u\"Pure Organic Raw Fruit & Nut Bars say:  Nothing Cooked.  Nothing Processed. Artificial Nuthin'.  Further claims are:Certified Organic (by Quality Assurance International (QAI)Gluten FreeFull Serving FruitOrganic ProteinRich in Omega-3sGood Source of FiberRawVeganConsistency:  Dense, moist bar - blueberries discernibleTaste/Ingredients: The first ingredient in the Wild Blueberry Pure bar is dates.  In fact, blueberries rank #5 on the ingredient list and they are combined (infused?) with organic apple juice and organic sunflower oil.  The Wild Blueberry bar taste reflects the ingredient order - much more of a date bar flavor than a blueberry bar flavor.I couldn't compare the Pure bar directly with Larabar or Soyjoy (what I had on hand) because I didn't have the same flavors in those brands - on hand- Soyjoy Strawberry Bar & Larabar Apple Bar.  Taste-wise, the apple & the strawberry bars tasted more like the real fruit, while the Pure blueberry did not; however, density & moisture seemed to be about equal in all bars (Soyjoy was a smaller bar at 1.06 oz)Nutrition:  This is a single serving bar that packs a calorie count of 190.  The protein count is 6g and total fat is 8g.  Fruit & Nut Bar-wise this bar ranks right in there with similar fruit & nut bars (Larabar & Soyjoy, although Pure seems to have a bit more protein).Overall Impression:  For my tastes, while the fruit & nut bars (Pure, Larabar, Soyjoy, etc.) are convenient & easy to carry around, I more apt to stick with real (unprocessed) fruit & nuts, especially given the caloric count in each bar and the fact that the flavor doesn't send me to the box wanting more.\", u\"Most power bars - especially all natural ones - have a ton of egg and other things in them to hold them together.  This is the first vegan bar I've had that actually tastes good and holds together.  The flavor is good and you'll enjoy every bite of it!\", u\"I was a bit skeptical with a organic, vegan fruit bar.  I was expecting it to be a dry mess.  Instead, I was very happily surprised.  There is a ton of flavor in the bar.  The blueberry flavor was very strong and I can see the chunks of walnuts and fruit in the bar.  In addition, the bar wasn't dry but was moist enough to really enjoy.  I like that this bar contains has as many raw ingredients in it as most food in bar form are crap.  Given the nutrition information and taste, I think I would consider this as a snack for my son.\", u\"The Pure organic bar is lacking in flavor but it is a good substitute for a meal if you are in a hurry or in need of a snack.  It's moist and not crumbly like granola bars and while the flavor is bland, at least it doesn't taste awful like so many other energy bars.I am not a nutritionist nor do I go out of my way to eat healthy, but that this bar is certified organic and has a lot of natural products in it which is a plus.For energy bar, it'll do.\", u'I really liked this.  I have also tried the Blueberry flavored bar, which I thought was wonderful.  This is healthy, though not really low fat.  There are 9g of fat, but since it\\'s from walnuts, cashews, and almonds, at least it\\'s the \"good\" fat.  There\\'s plenty of fiber (4g) and protein (6g) to keep you feeling full for a couple hours.  No cholesterol, low sodium (5mg) and no weird ingredients that are hard to pronounce.This is soft and chewy - the nuts are chopped pretty fine so it\\'s not crunchy.  Dates are the top ingredient, though you can taste the cherry and nuts very well.As far as a healthy snack, this is well worth the price.  It\\'s sweet enough to consider it a treat, but not bad for you like a candy bar would be.  I might have to invest in more of these.  :)', u'I have had some trouble finding a whole, nutritional food snack for those mid-morning cravings or as a breakfast substitute for those busy mornings. The flavor is suttle, but rich. I also liked the fact that my body liked it too. No bubbling tummy or noisey digestive sounds. I have had this problem with other health bars, but not this one!', u\"At last, someone has put on the market a health food bar that meets all the qualifications of being organic, gluten-free, dairy free, and MSG free.  As someone who struggles daily to eat healthy, I have often found it difficult to eat something quickly that is both gluten-free and organic.  Especially on the days when I'm rushing to work and haven't any time to prepare a meal.  This bar is the answer to my dilemna.  While most breakfast/snack bars are heavy on the nut or oats side and sparing on the fruit side, this bar is very heavy on the fruit side.  However, I was relieved to find that it isn't overly sweet.  In fact, I found this cherry flavor to be just right in maintaining the balance of not being too tart and not too sweet.  In sum, I'm relieved to find that this truly healthy snack bar is out there and I very much recommend it!\", u'The taste is good, with the blueberry predominating, followed by the nuts, and I tasted more walnut than cashew even though cashew was listed first in the ingredients list. The gluten-free bread is chewey and not too bad, just a little doughy/dry - quite acceptable with a glass of milk though! Nutritionally the bar is a bit high on carbs, moderate on fat and low on sodium. Better for hiking than home snacking IMO.', u'I was certain I\\'d prefer the blueberry flavor when I got both blueberry and cherry of this Pure bar as I\\'m a far more of a blueberry fan than a cherry fan due to the typical acidity of cherry...but the cherry one was by far my favorite of the two. Very smooth cherry flavor. Although I\\'m also a big fan of the cashews...both for nutritional reasons and flavor, you won\\'t taste much cashew in the bar, per se, as they are finely ground.Did I like it a lot? Yes.  Did I crave more? Not really. But I tend to eat more veggies and protein than I ever do fruit as a personal preference so, that being said, I think they may very well be \"crave-able\" to fruit fans wanting a healthy boost.I workout every day and love a good energy-burst bar prior to doing so, but have found most powerbars are packed with refined sugar and artificial ingredients. That\\'s a boost that undoes all the good my workout does! So finding one that\\'s filled with good natural things is always a quest I am on. While some of the newer bars have \"natural\" ingredients, however, this one goes a step further by having those natural ingredients also be organic...so the chemicals used in growing fruits in some bars that may or may not be washed off prior to processing into a natural bar is not a concern here. That\\'s especially good for a healthy snack for kids, but is a preferance for myself as well.The bar is entirely \"raw\" organic foods...the best for your body, filled with antioxidants. It is high fiber and has 400 mg of omega 3s...very important and many would rather eat a treat than salmon. They are gluten free, dairy free, nongmo.The ingredient list is basic...no refined sugar, just organic cherries, nuts, dates...natural things.These are certified organic. Some foods that claim to be organic have been shown not to be...so this stamp is important meaning it\\'s regulated. They are low sodium.So why one less star? The small bar also has 200 calories. That may not matter to many, but I am short and also have a small build and 200 calories for a snack is actually too much for me if I don\\'t want to undo an entire workout. Eating this as an energy bar prior to a workout would, therefore, undo my whole workout. I wish they could lower the fruit sugars a tad...BUT, that sad...this bar kept me full for a LONG time!! Because of the high fiber and good whole foods, it lasts so it\\'s great to pack if you know you are gonna be on the go somewhere with little time to grab something healthy.', u'This bar has pretty healthy ingredients in it.  The taste was okay.  It kind of reminded me of an undercooked blueberry muffin.', u'This product reminded me a lot ofthis similar item by Larabar, and although I must say this tasted pretty good I liked that Larabar version a bit better (I feel like Larabar had a little more flavor).  Overall not a bad product, but if this was sitting next to a Larabar \"Cherry Pie\", I\\'d grab the Larabar.', u'When asked how they tasted, my other half was skeptical that I would like these. We usually have opposing tastes for the same item.  One of my acquaintances actually spat the first bite out and begrudgingly ate the rest as not to waste it. So when I finally got around to trying these for myself I was pleasantly surprised at the chewy softness of the berries and the deliciousness of the dark chocolate with a hint of cardboard like taste but not too badly. I would recommend these because of the healthiness of the product and yes I did want to eat the wrapper!', u'I was looking forward to the taste of cherries. What I got was a dark, dense, unpleasantly non-cherry chunk that was slightly sour-tasting. It is something I might keep in my car on the offchance that I get caught in a blizzard and find myself stranded in a snowbank for three days. This bar would keep me alive ... and keep me opening the car door to swallow lots of snow in order to get the taste out of my mouth. Disappointing and not something I would recommend.', u'I chose this rating because a high sugar content was not revealed online before buying it. Might as well have bought real brownies.', u\"I got these because I wanted something to take with me that wouldn't melt. This bar does that job. I also got these because the ingredients are organic and simple--no additives and especially becuase they didn't have any sugar in them. The flavor names sounded so enticing, but truthfully they all tasted quite similar, with only slight differences in taste. They do not taste bad, but they aren't especially tasty either! I will continue to purchase these for their portability until I find something else with similarly simple ingredients and no sugar. I love it that they are sweetened with Agave nectar!\", u\"This super dense fruit bar was about on par with others I've tasted -- and that's not saying much.  First off, the grayish color is not very appetizing, the moistness felt strange being also that it is so dense and jam-packed with a mush of everything, and the flavor itself was overall flat, although there were hints of sweetness here and there.  Since I tend to think that most bars of this sort are pretty gross to begin with (!), I gave this one three stars because it certainly wasn't worse than the others, it is a hearty little snack, and I'll give credit for the natural ingredients.\", u'This may be good for you, but it is like eating cardboard with a few nuts tossed in. One bite was too much.', u\"I love to have meal bars in my purse because they are great when I don't have time to stop and eat a snack (and might otherwise reach for fast food).  However, many of them have long ingredient lists or leave something to be desired in flavor.  These Pure bars address this completely.  Much like the Lara bars they have a short list of minimally processed ingredients.  If you're tried of bars with lots of additives or ingredients you cannot pronounce you will likely find this refreshing.  The taste is also pretty decent.  Granted, it's all a matter of personal preferences, but I find these okay to eat.  It's not something I would excitedly eat over dessert, but i's definitely palatable and reminds me of a blueberry muffin.  If you've tried the Lara bars I would say the flavor and consistency are very similar.  That said, they are definitely not as tasty or texturally appealing as the bars that have more ingredients (i.e. Odwalla or Luna).  Of course, it's all about making tradeoffs so if a long ingredient list doesn't bother you, you may prefer the other two brands.  However, if you're looking for somehting with a short ingredient list that is raw, vegan, gluten-free, or certified organic this is a good choice.The bottom line is this.  I personally think it's hard to make a bar with only a few ingredients that are all natural that tastes as good as the more processed bars, but overall this one does a pretty good job.\", u\"This is my second Pure Bar flavor I've tried. It primarily tastes like cherry with just a hint of cashew. I'm more of a blueberry fan, so if I was going to eat another Pure Bar, I would go with the Blueberry that is a little more balanced. Otherwise, I found this Cherry bar tasted fine, with a balance of chew more like a fruit bar than any kind of granola bar.\", u\"I've had a variety of fruit bars over the years and this is definitely one of the worst. It doesn't have a great deal in the way of good flavor and it's over burdened with cashews and walnuts (neither of which I like). The labeling makes great hey out of the fact that it's not got gluten, doesn't use GMO's, has no cholesterol, no trans-fats, and that the blueberries used therein are raw. Because, you know, mankind was doing fine before we actually started cooking our foods.Beyond the hype of the product, there's not really anything worthwhile here, and lord help you if you have a nut allergy. This thing just didn't taste good and I can't say as though I have any interest in ever eating any more. Put it this way: When I first opened the box I was a little disappointed to see only one bar therein instead of a pack of twelve. Now I'm just relieved.\", u'I love blueberries.  I love Luna bars, but this bar was terrible.  Just terrible.  The texture is that of a wet, soggy power bar.  The taste is bland and awful, I am not sure.  This was so terrible I spit it out.  Its difficult to describe the taste because it was so...gross.  This is so terrible, I am not even going to keep typing about it.  I am not kidding.Note: \"Pure\" and \"Organic\" does not mean that it has to taste bad and feel disgusting.  This product merely does.', u'I was hoping for a good experience, but was dissapointed.  The bar was very oily and had a lack of taste.  I couldnt finish it.', u\"Nutrition Information:Calories 190fat Cal 70total Fat 8gcholest 0mgfiber 3gsugars 17gprotein 7gThe packaging is enticing, I'd at least pick it up in the grocery store to look at since it's organic.  But, it is pretty high in calories for such a small bar.  The consistency was like a very thick fruit roll up (very sweet and chewy) with chunks of cashews throughout, which was the only part I liked.  It was too heavy for me.  I'll stick with some of the other bars lower in calories if I'm in a pinch (really enjoy Luna bars).\", u\"Vegan AND gluten-free? It's so hard to find products that are both those things, much less that taste great. My first bite of a Pure Bar was the Chocolate Brownie one. OMG! It was amazing! I still can't believe that something good for me tastes this phenomenal. I'm back to buy more.\", u\"My first thought was that I wanted a second because the bar is not large and I consumed it quickly.  You can see and taste blueberries.  At the same time, blueberries are not the dominant fruit.  Dates are the first ingredient and blueberries fifth.  I think of this as a date bar with blueberries added.  For such a small bar it has a lot of calories - 190, but I didn't detect a sugar rush.  Thus the energy in this bar is relatively slow burning, which is good.This type of fruit/nut bar seems superior to many granola bars that tend to be sticky to the teeth. It didn't take but a couple moments for me to eat this bar. That's 190 calories that were consumed rapidly. Therefore, this bar is not a substitute for fresh fruit and grains, although the packaging makes it convenient is ways that healthier foods cannot always compete.I think this is a healthy snack if one doesn't consume several at once, which is exactly what I would do because it didn't take but a moment for me to finish one.  I liked the taste of this dense, small bar.\", u\"I'm not usually a fan of power bars and the like. They strike me as fake food.  The Pure Bare Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar, however, is good -- and real.  It's tart and tasty and surprisingly filling. You can see the bits of real nuts and the cherry taste is amazing. A mom recommended snack.\", u'My kids are chronic cereal/fruit/nut bar consumers. They eat them for breakfast, snacks, lunch and, if I would allow, dinner. We are always on the look out for new products that are delicious, but also healthy. So, the Pure Bar definitely appealed to us. When our sample bar arrived, I cut each of my kids (hereafter \"the bar nuts\") a slice. I deliberately separated them to ascertain their opinions.First up - the picky bar nut - my elementary school aged child: she was highly skeptical of the bar based on appearance. It is kind of a muddy colored mush. She took a small bite, chewed while pulling a face and said, \"I don\\'t like this, do I have to eat any more?\" I asked her what she didn\\'t like about the bar and it was basically everything from flavor to texture to appearance.Second-at-bat - the laid back bar nut - my middle school/cool child. He didn\\'t mind the appearance of the bar, in fact I am not sure he took note of it at all. He put the entire piece of bar in his mouth, chewed it slowly and said, \"yeah, these are good.\" Upon intensive grilling he admitted to liking the texture of the bar and the sweetness but noted that the nuts did not add flavor. (Whew - what is it with this age boy? It is like pulling teeth to get anything non-gaming system related out of them.)Third in line - the bar nut connoisseur - my young high schooler is the biggest bar consumer. He can empty a box in an afternoon. He was probably the most excited about the bar tasting and eagerly agreed to give his expert opinion. I gave him a jumbo slice of the bar and sat back to await the verdict. First he cleansed his palate with water, next he sniffed the bar, then he took a good sized bite, he slowly chewed the bar and a look of . . . total revulsion crossed his face. He swallowed and announced, \"personally, I think it rather horrible.\"Last at bat - the fashionable bar nut - my eldest child likes her bars fruit filled and healthy. She definitely liked the fact that the bars were organic and filled with raw fruit and nuts. She said that the packaging and bar appearance made her think they would be good for you. She liked the fruity sweetness of the bars and found the texture to be much like those of the multigrain cereal bars but a bit denser. When told that the tasting event was over, she promptly snatched up the remaining bits of the bar and gobbled them down.All in all I would say that these bars are a matter of taste. If you like really sweet, dense nut bars you will probably like these. If you are more of a grainy, crunchy bar lover, you probably won\\'t. A side note: the bars contain 190 calories and 8g of fat.', u\"I've been eating organic food for a long time and the quality of organic convenience food has come an amazingly long way.  These bars are not the chewy, dry, oaty bars of the past, they are really, really good.  They taste rich and flavorful and are delightfully moist.  Delicious!\", u\"At 190 cals this is no lightweight bar.  Heavy and filling, it is not at all candy-like, granola-like, or even particularly similar to a cereal bar with fruit filling.  The whole bar is a solid piece which reminded me of the texture of fruitcake, without the sense of biting off chunks of fruit.  The nut pieces are small, but visible.  I can imagine this being quite helpful to long distances hiked, biked or ran...and it would do as breakfast with a glass of milk.Notes:  Labeled USDA organicCertified Gluten-freeRawVeganNO GMO, preservatives, artificial additives.After reading that, I'm thinking it would make a great addition to a toddler bag...\", u'This cherry and cashew bar was tasty! The sweetness sort of creeps up on you. It is like a thick fruity \"leather\" bar, but not at all tough to chew. My son, who is six and loves dried fruit, wanted to eat the whole bar himself. We finally convinced him to share. It\\'s nice to know it was made with high quality ingredients. It would make a great snack on a hike or at the zoo. They make them in blueberry as well. Give it a shot!', u\"Love Organic, Raw food of ANY type. These bars are soy and GMO-free, which is nice. Wish they had more protein and fewer calories but I realize it's hard to do both. All told, you can't go wrong with Pure.\", u'I exercise often.  Running and boot camp.  I have tried many bars and gels.  This bar was yummy and filling.  Filled with lots of protien and a great after workout treat.', u\"Sounded good....organic, no refined sugar, lots of vitamins/minerals, antioxidants, low sodium....but alas....I would not purchase this.  First off it looked well, yucky, a rectangular brown bar...not appealing, but if it tastes good, I thought, then I could get past the unappetizing look.  So, I took a bite and well, it tastes like your Aunt's old fruitcake recipe, except chewier.  I'm sorry, but no matter how much I want to snack on healthier foods and buy organic, I can't recommend this one.  I got a bit of a nutty taste, but couldn't quite taste the cherry either, but maybe it was because I couldn't get past the fruitcake'y' kind of flavor.So, though you could buy many bars that taste worst, I will not be purchasing this one. It just didn't have the appealing look or flavor to make me buy it.  Too bad-looks like there are lots of reasons why, if it tasted good that this would be the one to buy, but once again I vote flavor over just good for you, so I'd have to give this one a pass.\", u\"I am primarily a raw foodist.  Although I have some cooked food on occasion, I prefer raw foods.  One thing that I have noticed is that packaged foods are not something I enjoy anymore.  They taste dead and lackluster.Such is NOT the case with Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.  WOW.  This bar is fantastic.  As a raw foodist, I am used to foods sweetened with fruits and dates, so I taste a good solid cherry flavor.  People not used to raw food style might taste more date as well.The texture is perfect- just enough richness with a little crunch from the nuts.  The balance of flavors is wonderful and the over all effect of the bar is fantastic.  I will definitely purchase these in the future- they would be great to take on trips or when I can not whip up a raw food meal in emergencies.  Just have to make sure to drink plenty of water with this as with all dehydrated foods.I am thrilled to have the opportunity to taste this bar.  And for whatever it is worth, the blueberry version of this bar is less rich than the cherry.  The cherry bar is perfect when you are in the mood for a decadent dessert but don't want to compromise raw eating.  I can not rave about this highly enough.\", u\"I ordered this because I've had (and still have) type 2 diabetes for over 20 years now.  I keep it under VERY tight control, my A1Cs have been normal (high normal, but normal) all that time, so any new product that can delight my taste buds containing relatively little sugar (or better yet, none), is something I'm willing to try.  I also love cherries and cashews, so I figured this was a no-brainer.When I opened the Pure bar, it was as if the bar was compressed together, and upon tasting it, I tasted dates and cherries almost exclusively, both of which I like. The consistency was good, and the bar was chewy, which I also liked, but not as crunchy from the cashews as I would have liked.  Where WERE these cashews, anyway?  I looked at the label, and noticed the order of ingredients, and the first three are dates, cashews and cherries, all organic. I think they pulverized the cashews too much as well as the walnuts and almonds in the bar, as they all lent a sort of nutty rather than crunchy consistency to the bar, and the flavor of each (especially the cashews), was indistinguishable from the others.  Since I love cashews, and it was listed as the second ingredient, I was disappointed I couldn't tell them apart flavor-wise.  Maybe if they didn't crush them so much, the flavor of the cashews would be as distinct as the flavors of the dates and cherries, which would elevate the taste of the bar from good to great.  The bar would also have been more crunchy, something that's satisfying to me in any fruit and nut bar, organic or not.I looked at the nutritional value and saw that there was 25 grams of carbs, 17 grams of sugar (from organic agave nectar), and 8 grams of fat in a 190 calorie 1.7 oz bar.  While the Pure bar tasted good and kudos for its ingredients being all organic, it fell short of my expectations, and I was thinking I could have an entire 16 oz. can of fruit (pineapple chunks or peach halves in their own juice), for about the same values (including calories), as this 1.7 oz. bar.For diabetic purposes, I WOULD carry one or two of these around if I knew I wasn't going to be home all day and missing a few meals.  They DO taste good, take up very little space, and I'm sure they would keep my energy and sugar levels up until I got home.  I also like the fact that they're completely organic.  But for a regular snack at home, I would rather have a natural fruit cup, piece of fruit or something with a lot less carbs and fat strictly on an ounce-for-ounce basis.\", u\"I liked this bar, but found the blueberry version of it to taste better. While the cherry is pretty good for many of the same reasons as the blueberry (fresh taste, just the right sweetness level) I found it somewhat bland. The cherry taste does not come through very well - I'd have a hard time saying this was cherry without looking at the wrapper. Thus, while I thought the blueberry was a five-star product, this really only rates a 4.5 or 4.Still, an enjoyable snack, and way better than reaching for a candy bar.\", u\"Well, this is a tough one.  The ingredients list is stellar, if you can forgive that the primary ingredient in this product is neither cherries nor cashews, but rather DATES.  (Yuck).  It's all stuff that's good for you and nothing that's not.  I think gluten- and dairy-free.  The consistency is moist and chewy, though stickier than I like.I am more of a cereal bar type gal.  I want a little flour in there somewhere to create a cakiness.  This thing was like mashed-up dried fruit molded into a bar shape, with some soggy nuts rolled in for good measure.  It had that sickly-sweet raisiny taste that some people enjoy, myself not among them.While I personally would never buy these again, I give them 3 stars for being a really quality product.  I am sure lots of people would like these, but they're just simply not my cup of tea.\", u\"This bar didn't taste terrible, but it didn't taste good, either.  Just kind of blah.  I split it with a friend, and all she could taste was sweetness with some cherry flavor, and all I could taste was a faint cashew flavor.  If you're looking for a benign organic option, high in calories (190 for a small bar), give this a try.  If you're looking for something higher in protein and more flavorful, look elsewhere.\", u\"There are several postives and negatives about the Pure Bar, with the positives outweighing the negatives for me, therefore, the four stars.Negatives: due to the all-organic, non-processed nature, they expire relatively quickly.  I don't eat this type of thing every day, so they wouldn't necessarily last the month-ish for me.  Despite not containing refined sugar, they still contain a high level of fruit sugars and they contain a very high level of things that many people are sensitive or allergic to and most importantly, are made in a facility that makes things that a very, very large number of people are dangerously allergic to, including wheat, peanuts and tree nuts.Positives: despite the pretty heavy taste of dates (for sweetness), there's a good blueberry and walnut taste as well and while it's borderline too sweet and at 190 calories, not exactly low calorie, it still comes out ahead of the other organic bars I've tasted (Think Organic and Raw Revolution).  In this particular bar, there are ten ingredients, all of which I actually can pronounce and know what they are, which is a good thing.Neutral: the texture was very uneven.  My first bite was smooth, the next bite had all sorts of nuts in it, the next bite had definite dates in it, the next bite had a tiny nut bit in it and otherwise was smooth.  It was strange that things weren't distributed better.\", u\"It's hard to determine a lot of things with a small sample of food except you like it, don't like it, and what the taste is like.  I expected something different since this was a Cherry Cashew bar, but it was mostly dates, so it was more like a fig newton.  The cherry taste came through a little, but the cashews were mostly wasted they may as well used a less expensive filler.Bottom line is I did like the bar, but it could be either made cheaper for what it is and still taste the same, or made better and maybe more expensive with more nuts, and more cherries.  I think the only nut that would come through well with a bar like this is maybe the pecan.  They might consider changing the formula a bit.\", u\"I recently got thePure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and thePure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).  I loved both of them but I liked this one a little more than the Cherry.  If you are familiar with products likeRaw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Chocolate & Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)then this has a very similar consistency.  I would categorize it as something a more like the density of a brownie and less like a granola style bar, but definitely not as chewy as power bar.  The bar is very filling but not real heavy on the stomach.I have completed 2 raw diet cleanses this year so far and find it more and more to my liking to eat organic and raw whenver possible.  These bars are vegan friendly, certified organic, raw, gluten free, and dairy free.  Somehow this bar packs quite a bit of taste into such a healthy sounding bar.  I really enjoy the natural flavor in this bar, which actually taste like blueberries, not the superficial candy blueberry flavoring that most processed foods have.  I like to eat one of these about an half hour before working out and then as a mid-day snack too.  Seems like the density of the nutrition really seems to stick with me longer than just a generic snack.  I have to say I was a big fan of Raw Revolution before trying these and didn't expect much from Pure Organic.  Now, Pure is going straight to my shopping list and will definitely be purchased again soon.\", u\"Passion fruits contain major medicinal benefits according to studies. It has a high amount of antioxidants which protect from cancer, ageing and inflammation. It's a good source of fiber which is effective to improve digestion. It also has high levels of potassium that helps reduce risk of heart attack. While its fruits may not always be readily available, I getMarkizza Passion Fruit Juice Drinkby delifreshusa.com on Amazon, that's all natural and refreshing, not from concentrate. Read about passion fruits to see for yourself.\", u'I am a gluten-free vegan.  Not that I\\'m a health fanatic--I eat french fries, they\\'re GF vegan-- I just have certain dietary restrictions due to health issues.  So of all people in the world, I felt like celebrating when I found this bar.  I chose to try the blueberry flavor because I love love love real blueberries but have always detested artificial blueberry flavor, so I always taste challenge any product that claims to have blueberries in it.So what did I think of it?  Well, I have tried to think of a nice, mature way to state my first impression, but I can\\'t.  It looks like poop.  It is brown, pureed, and has nuts and berry chunks in it.  Then I tasted it.  Not bad.  No artificial blueberry flavor, not overly sweet, but a natural sort of sweet.  Good.  I offered a bite to my 4-year-old, but she clamped her mouth and went wide-eyed and ran away without tasting.  I offered a bite to my husband and he liked it and wants to buy more... he will really eat anything, so that says nothing.  My 9-year-old son liked it... he is a PETA fan, quite a hippie, so there\\'s some background for you.  My 7-year-old daughter was not overly thrilled but would willingly eat it if she were hungry.  As for me, if I had to choose between these bars versus trail mix, I would take whatever is less expensive.  It really seemed to me to be trail mix in a different form... various nuts, rice protein, blueberries.If you are really into health, and feel the need for bars, this is the bar for you.  If you, like me, are willing to be healthy but still believe in a dash of sugar or salt or oil or something slightly evil, then you will give this bar four stars... it is good, but not a flavor fantasy.I\\'m curious about the last ingredient: \"organic blueberry flavor.\"  How is that different from \"organic wild blueberries\" which are listed higher up?  Or if it is just flavoring, who decided that it tastes more like an organic blueberry rather than a standard blueberry?  Or can processed flavoring itself be considered organic?  There are some of these nutritional nuances I will never figure out.', u'I have to admit I was expecting a bar much like a granola bar--hard, dry, and crunchy. Much to my shock, however, it was soft and chewy with a texture like that of a commercial packaged brownie, and the look was dark, reminding me of a dark gingerbread. The tang of cherry was notable and delicious. I may seriously have to consider buying some of these after my tasty little sample!!', u'It is hard to find healthy snack bars that do not taste like cardboard, but this bar was almost perfect. Moist, with bits of nut and dried fruit, it had a delicate, pleasant flavour. Another plus is that it contains NO soy lecithin, the nightmare of my allergic father-in-law.My only complaint, and it is minor: more chunky nuttiness would have been good - it is primarily ground up fruit paste. I love chunks. Still, I highly recommend this bar.', u\"I'm an omnivore who doesn't usually go in for special diet food, but this raw, gf bar was really tasty! It's not like your typical baked bar, not at all bready. It almost makes me think of a fruit leather with nuts in it, which, based on the ingredients, is pretty much what it is. It was very simple and natural tasting, sweet without being cloying, chewy, crunchy, and satisfying.I don't typically eat food bars (I'm more one for actual food), but if I needed some for travel or convenience, I would definitely choose these over any others I've eaten. Nice and moist, without that pulped cardboard texture most health-food meal/snack bars have. And this one is made entirely of recognizable food (Organic Dates, Organic Cherries, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Almonds, Organic Cashews, Organic Brown Rice Protein), not weird food-like components and derivatives (the exception being the brown rice protein, whatever that is).While they cost more than I'd be willing to pay for everyday use (as I said, I'm not really one for eating bars instead of food, so that sort of thing always seems like a bit of a ripoff to me), they're certainly on par in cost and size with other bars of their type, and for my money, much better, more natural and tastier.\", u\"I recently tried thePure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and didn't like them at all so I didn't get my hopes up for this flavor. However to my disbelief, I actually enjoyed the wild blueberry bars. It was a totally different experience for me. The mixture of fresh blueberry and nuts makes a great combination. I let my kids try a bite and then went on and on about how much they liked them. These bars are 100% natural without any added preservatives or artificial flavoring. I would recommend these for sure unlike the cherry cashew bars.\", u'I buy a lot of raw food bars, and this is one of the better ones.  Some are hard to chew, or too dry, but this one was moist and tender, and full of flavor.  It was a little on the sweet side, but that appeals to the kids.  I really like the fact that they are marked gluten free.  With a family that includes several celiacs, it makes it nice to be able to look at a label and see that something is gluten free without having to call the company or check the website.', u'I liked the Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.  The nuts in it stand out a lot more than the fruit (with the walnuts showing the strongest flavor in the bar), but the overall flavor is pleasantly fresh tasting.  The bar is organic and lacks a lot of the ingredients one might want to avoid; such as sodium and processed sugar (though the bar does have 19g of natural fruit sugars).', u'I wasn\\'t too crazy about the texture of this bar, as much as I wanted to like it.  It was a lot gooey-er than I prefer.  However the content is great, and I appreciate that.  This bar is vegan, good for Celiac Disease sufferers as it is gluten-free.  I would compare it a bit to the Pro Bar Fruition bar.  This bar has a higher protein count, which is always good in my opinion.  This bar has 6 grams of protein versus the 3 grams in the Pro Bar.  Both bars are the same size  The calorie count for the Pure Bar is a little higher (190 calories vs. 160 calories) but the real difference is the calories from fat.  With the Pure Bar 70 calories are from fat, vs. only 20 being from fat with the Pro Bar.  But don\\'t forget that the Pure Bar has twice as much protein than the Pro Bar.It has lots of great organic ingredients, and the wrapper states that \"nothing is cooked or processed\", which doesn\\'t really matter too much to me, but must be important to some.To me it comes down to texture and flavor, plus the protein count.  I wouldn\\'t eat this on a regular basis, but would come in handy for a mid-day snack when I\\'m out and about.  Since this bar has no chocolate type coating, it would hold up well in the heat.  Also since it\\'s gooey-ish, it wouldn\\'t get pulverized in my purse when carrying it around and forgetting about it.  (right?!)', u\"I was asked to review this for Amazon Vine. I also reviewed the Cherry Pure Bar. Personally, I thought the Cherry bar had a little better taste, but the Blueberry was pretty good as well. These are great for a heavy snack, when you want to fill that craving, but you can't have a lot of calories. I'm personally doing Weight Watchers diet program and I'm always on the lookout for low point, high satisfaction snacks. This one fits the bill.MY only contention is this. This is not a light snack by any means. Its pretty heavy. That's cool if you need an afternoon pick-me-up or an early morning breakfast grab, but just know that it fills.\", u\"I really tried to like the Wild Blueberry bar but I just did not enjoy it all. It sounds good in theory-no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial ingredients,  no refined sugar, it's rich in Omega-3s, it's got fiber, it's got calcium and it's a full serving of fruit. On my first taste, I chewed it a couple times before spitting it out. My second bite went down but I just couldn't get into the flavor. The calorie count is rather high for a small bar and I think I could find something more satisfying, more tasty, and just as healthy to eat for about the same amount of calories.\", u\"I like this one much better than the blueberry version. The cranberry gives it a very sweet taste that I love. I wouldn't mind eating this again. It makes a great snack in the morning when I want something sweet but healthy.\", u\"We love Pure Bar because it's raw and very few ingredients. My son has allergies to gluten and dairy. There are nuts in these bars, but no peanuts to my knowledge. Awesome healthy snack!\", u\"I admittedly have not tried many of these types of bars, but I do avoid processed foods in my diet, so these appealed to me as a way to get some additional fruit into my diet in a convenient way. I wasn't disappointed. The bars are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, and they're pleasantly chewy. I'll definitely be grabbing these whenever I'm in the mood for a sweet snack.\", u'This was a very good bar, chewy with nuts and cherry.  It actually was filling and satisfying.  I do not know how much they sell for, but they would go well on a trip to fill in-between craves.  They certainly were better than granola bars.', u'These bars have a good taste, smell and texture.  Not great, but definitely good.  I found the blueberry taste a bit lost.  Not too sweet and yet they did appease my sweet tooth.  There was no adverse after taste.  They are quite dense and moist and very satisfying.  If not for the price they would make a very good workday snack.', u\"I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this bar.  The nut flavor was good and nice and crunchy, but it didn't taste anything like blueberries.  It was kind of a gooey (or gluey), chewy bar with a taste that is hard to describe.  Not a bad taste, but I doubt it's anything kids would like that much.  I assume there is no added sugar, which is a real plus.  I suppose it is good to be eating something natural, but why not just eat the nuts and blueberries separately instead of crushed and compacted into a bar?  Convenience would be the only reason I can think of and these would have a longer shelf life than fresh blueberries.  Great for campers or hikers who don't want a high sugar snack.\", u\"Basically this bar tastes like a fig newton without the pastry outer layer. That's what it reminded me of.I guess if you are craving something sweet and nutritious this might be the way to go. I wasn't excited by it.The blueberry taste was good. I'm not into fruit bars much but I can't fault this product.I've tasted better fruit bars such as the PROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar.\", u\"This bar has a rather odd soft texture and an earthy but pleasant nut taste with only a hint of blueberry.  It seems as though it may be somewhat healthy but overall I can't get too excited.  I would rather just have a few roasted almonds and dried apricots for example which would be equally healthy and just as tasty.\", u'Of the 2 I tested, I liked the Wild Blueberry bar much more.  Overall, both are very soft, dense and have a decent amount of nutrition to help curb your otherwise unhealthy snacking.', u\"This raw fruit and nut bar was very good. Not too sweet or tart. And it's not one of those jaw-numbing chew fests. This is a simple, healthy snack that tastes great. Gluten-free, low sodium, natural fruit sugars and flavorful. What's not to love?  I will definitely buy these again.\", u'love blueberries but barely tastes like blueberry, good idea but no real flavor and not filling in anyway', u\"Delicious and much better for us than a candy bar.  We eat these only occassionally since it's not a super healthy choice.  But, it definitely tastes good and satisfies when you have a sweet tooth acting up.\", u'The texture reminded me of the center of a Fig Newton cookie but slightly moister. I would use these on a camping trip or hiking event but would not use on a daily basis.  The flavor was bland and I did not care for the texture which I found to be pastey.  Tended to stick to the roof of my mouth and was a little hard to swallow.  Did not get a distinct blueberry flavor. The most flavorful was when a bite would contain a nut.  The actual appearance of the bar is not appealing in the least.  I almost threw half of it away but then went ahead and forced the rest down.  Organic healthy snacks can be healthy and taste good but not this bar.  I kept thinking of wet soggy flavored cardboard.', u'Considering that this is a \"cherry cashew\" bar, there was little distinctive cherry or cashew taste to this product.  The texture was appealing and it is nice to have visible pieces of nuts vs. ground meal but in a blind test, I would have described this as a fruit and walnut bar of some generic type.  Even though it does not contain milk, the fact that it is made in the same plant with dairy products makes it questionably vegan. Reminiscent of Lara bars but not nearly as good.', u'I was really not looking foward to trying this bar. My past experiences with other nutrition/snack bars have been unsatisfactory to say the least. What I usually got, depending on the bar, was a nasty taste of sawdust or something that was way too sweet in an attempt to taste good. Usually I could only stand one or two bites before tossing the remainder. That was not the case with this bar. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed it!The taste of bluberry comes right through alongside of the nuts and other ingredients. The sweetness was just right. I had the feeling that I was eating something wholesome, natural and nourishing. This is something that I could indeed eat daily as a snack or meal replacement.', u\"I only received one bar in which to base my review, so three bites later, here we are.  First, I liked the list of ingredients.  They mainly were comprised of uncooked nuts and fruit, organic too.  Not being a big advocate for raw and organic (I just keep thinking how do they get rid of the bad bacteria and cancer causing fungi without high-heat pasteurization and agriculturally applied fungicide), I'm thinking that this bar cannot taste good, but it does.  Take a handful of raw mixed nuts and blend it with some dried fruit and that is what this bar tastes like.  Pretty good.\", u\"I'm not a cashew fan so I braced myself to be objective regardless of my personal likes and dislikes (it's a cherry cashew bar after all).  To my surprise I found the taste of cashew was very faint as walnuts and almonds were the more prominent nutty flavors.  That can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on how much cashew you wanted in your bar.  What does explode is an incredible amount of sweet cherry flavor along with the fibrous texture common in health bars.  It has enough sugar (via agave syrup and already sweet Oregon cherries) to equal a couple of chocolate chip cookies, frankly, but if you'd rather get your sweets from nature it's a tasty choice.\", u\"I'll keep the date puns short, but I'm not a huge date fan and it's the first ingredient. While there is a subtle taste of cherry the predominant flavor was clearly dates.Unfortunately, the bar I ate had multiple nutshells in it and I had an awkward crunch on what should have been a soft and chewy item.Don't consider this a protein bar. With 6 grams of protein along with 14 grams of sugar and 9 grams of fat, this is a snack bar and not any type of meal replacementBetter than a brownie, but not by much.\", u'I really liked the flavor of these bars, but the texture was kind of grainy. The size was a little smaller then the average nutrition bar, but it was pretty filling. I really liked the fact that it is organic, because I do buy a lot of organic products. I just think they could improve a little on the texture.', u\"I was trying to decide whether to give it 3 stars (it's okay, for a granola bar) or 5 stars (it's really awesome for a *gluten free* granola bar, since most have gluten or at least are at risk for cross-contamination.)  I settled on averaging them.  It tastes good and is sweet.  The texture is kind of odd.  My 11 year old son wants me to order more of them, he likes them better than Clif bars.\", u\"I am generally not a fan of power bars, as I find that they have an unpleasant aftertaste. This bar, on the other hand, was sweet, tasty, and filling, without the aftertaste. I would be comfortable eating this as a breakfast bar, for an on-the-go snack, or for dessert after any meal.  I think this would be great school snack for kids, far better than the over sweetened granola bars you find at the grocer's.\", u\"This bar is a blend of chopped nuts, rice protein and mashed blueberries, with agave nectar providing the sweetener (fructose). It tastes better than bars based on grains, but this also means it's 190 calories per 1.7oz bar (for comparison, a can of regular soda is 130). Flavor is pretty good, texture is OK, appearance is so-so. Good if you want to get away from the typical oat-and-sugar bar.\", u\"Considering the amount of raw nutrition packed into these puppies, they're actually pretty tasty.  A great meal on the go or a quick pick-me-up mid-day.  I'd rate them 4.5 stars if I could.  :)\", u'I was surprised how good this tasted. It taste similar, though not exactly  like it was fruit leather. It had just the right balance of nuts without seeming too much. Obviously taste will very, so you are probably best to try one before buying 12.Typically, Organic = Expensive. But for $20 you get 12, which i think is pretty reasonable priced for these. If you are into fitness or eating healthy, this may be something you really enjoy.', u\"Like many middle aged people I've recently begun to restrict my sodium. These Pure Bars give me a snack I can throw in my bag that has almost no sodium. It makes a nice treat.\", u\"First off a warning for all Celiac suffer's: Despite the wrappers thrilling proclamation that this product is Gluten Free, it also admits that it is made in a facility that processes wheat products. For super-sensitive suffers like my dad this bar is squarely in the No-No column.That being put forth the bar itself is actually pretty good as far as taste. There is a very definite blueberry flavor which is both sweet & tangy. The downside is that it is very small and that I needed to eat 2-3 of these to achieve the same sustenance that is equal to a Kellogg's protein bar or Luna bar. If you want flavor and are willing to pay for it then you might not be put off by the fact that you need to eat several to feel full.I work in construction, a lot of time I get too busy to stop and eat a proper lunch and I live on protein bars to get me through the afternoon. So far my favs are the Power-bar Harvest bars and the Peppermint stick Luna bar for sustenance and flavor. It would be really neat if the Pure bar was bigger and could offer the same feeling of fullness and energy because these would blow the Cliff bars right off the planet.(sawdust, anyone?)I loved the flavor, I just wish there was more of it so I didn't have to eat so many as protein bars are not cheap it's good to get as much as you can from them, unfortunately only one Pure bar left me hungry less than an hour later.\", u'This is a great-tasting bar.  Tangy cherry + nuts really reminds me of a fruit cake.  I has 190 calories and nutritional content similar to Zone bars.  However, I felt a bit more full while chewing on a Zone Bar.  Oddly enough I think its because Zone bars require more chewing and Pure Bars are very soft and delicate and you can finish them rather quickly.  Obviously the more chewing you do, the longer it takes you to finish the bar and by the time you ate one, your brain already told your stomach that it has something inside.  Therefore, I find Pure Bars to be more addicting and would eat them more as a snack(candy bar alternative,) rather than a meal replacement bar.', u\"As a Naturopathic Doctor I am very aware of the food I put in my body.  I'm also conscious that eating small amounts of food all day long instead of three meals is better for the body and keeps the energy level even.  These Pure Fruit and Nut bars (organic! raw! vegan! gluten free!) are full of protein.  All the flavors are delicious so get the variety pack.  I highly recommend these.\", u\"I'm always looking for good organic products.  I really like the concept of these bars.  Every single ingredient is natural and organic, which is rare to find these days. My experience with organic products is always hit or miss, however, and this bar is somewhere in between.It's tasty and filling, which is nice.  It's not very sweet at all which really surprised me - I don't think there are many (or any) added sugars.  The texture is something that I need to get used to though.  It's chewy and kind of mushy, brown, and just a little...unusual.  I know they have no added artificial ingredients so what you are eating is in its natural state, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Frankly, I prefer these 1000 times over a Nutri-grain bar.  But the texture is definitely something I need to get used to.I'd recommend seeing if you can find one of these sold in singles in a health food store to see if you like it. If so, the price for a box on Amazon isn't bad at all.\", u\"I was not overly impressed with this flavor of raw fruit & nut bar.  It was okay... not bad but not great.  I don't think I would buy this flavor.  There was a lack of nuts and the cherry and cashew flavors just did not seem to go together that nicely.  The texture was fine (aside from the lack of nuts).The Wild Blueberry Pure Bar is definitely my favorite and worth seeking out.  Cherry cashew - not so much.  I still give the cherry cashew version 3 stars because it is organic and contains all recognizable ingredients and is pretty healthy.\", u\"I had the opportunity to try both the cherry cashew and the wild blueberry flavors. This flavor gets an extra star for the taste.While I still feel that those enjoying a raw food lifestyle would be better off making their own snack bars...this flavor might find its way into my shopping basket on a regular basis.Here is my reveiw fromt the cherry cashew flavor:I love that this bar is made from raw foods!! I've been trying to incorporate raw foods into half of my diet. For this, the bar earns 5 stars.The taste takes some of this away. I've prepared raw foods. I've sampled many raw foods prepared by others. I know they can taste awesome. The taste of this bar was just meh. Not offensive. Not drool-worthy. Just meh.Otherwise an excellent source of nutrients. Maybe I'd buy it if it were on sale & I was in immediate need of such snack. Otherwise I'm better off with my home-prepared raw snacks. Good attempt though and it's far healthier than many of the snack bars on the market.\", u\"It is hard to review something when do don't know how others will use it.Is this item healthy? It depends on how you look at it.It has 17 grams of sugar, only 7 grabs of protein, and only 3 grams of fiber. At 190 calories it also has 70 of it's calories coming from fat.It tastes really good, and would be a good candy bar replacement for a child, or a good fuel for a long hike or bike ride, where you need carbohydrates, but for anything other than intense aerobic exercise I don't think it is suitable because of the high sugar content. Kashi products often will get you less calories, more fiber, and more protein, (thus making you feel fuller after eating) and so make a better meal replacement or simple snack.190 calories and 17 grams of sugar is calories and sugar be it from an organic food bar or a Snickers.If you're trying to lose weight, I would not recommend it, get something with less sugar, more protein, and more fiber. But if you're packing for a hike or a bike ride or running a marathon, by all means eat away.\", u'I thought the Pure bar was delicious (bluebery).  Very healthy, nice texture, great taste.  A bit to expensive for my regulary grocery list, but these were very, very good.', u'This bar has a good texture and a good flavor. It was a great afternoon pick-me-up, I did not get hungry until suppertime. I have just began to eat more healthy natural foods, and snacks are hard to find. I will be ordering more of these bars, and plan on having them as a quick breakfast as well.', u'This is a great bar.  Not only is there no refined sugar in it, but, it also provides great energy.I felt an incredible \"boost.\"I only wish that they were bigger.', u\"This is one of the most satisfying energy/snack bars that I have come across. The pure nut and fruit flavor is very light and does not make you feel like you are eating processed food at all. Unlike many other sports bars, there is also no discernable aftertaste, nor does this bar leave you feeling bloated or otherwise uncomfortable. This is probably one of the healthiest on-the-go snacks or meal replacements that you'll find.\", u'liked the taste of these bars. would buy - a good snack, a good value', u'The perfect food !  No cholesterol , very low sodium unlike even the Atkins Bars---  high in Potassium / Protein which is what we need!!!  Am so pleased that I found these. Great for traveling -- or that long jaunt that might force you into a junk food palace:)', u'I\\'m always looking for a way to quickly eat a healthful midday snack. The problem is that Butterfinger and 3 Musketeers bars taste good but have no redeeming value whatsoever, and alternative snack bars that provide reasonable nutritional return generally taste like cardboard - or at least as how I imagine cardboard would taste were I to try it.So here we have a Pure Organic Wild Blueberry \"raw fruit & nut bar.\" Sounds good. I like raw fruit and I like nuts, so I\\'m inspired by the wrapper. The wrapper also has a sketch of \"Veronica,\" the creator of the PURE bar. I know nothing about Veronica but she appears trustworthy. She doesn\\'t look like she just chewed on cardboard. The nutritional information indicates that there is 6g of protein here among 190 total calories. There\\'s a small amount of multiple nutrients, but nothing stands out in terms of this being a significant source for anything critical. On the other hand, there\\'s nothing bad here. So this bar looks, from the numbers, to be a reasonable snack.My bar says, \"Best by 14 MAR 11.\" That seems very specific given the time until then. On March 13, 2011, it will be fine, but on March 15, all bets are off. But I\\'m assuming that 14 MAR 11 means March 14, 2011 and maybe it means something else.On opening, the bar has a pleasant aroma. It looks like a fig newton turned inside out. The consistency is similar to the inside of a fig newton without being quite as gooey. It\\'s pleasantly moist, without the uncomfortably dry texture so familiar from similar products. The bar contains nuts. I was pleased to see that I could identify the contents by taste; I looked at the ingredient list only after tasting the bar. There are no artificial additives here, and even the natural flavorings don\\'t overpower the bar. There wasn\\'t too much sweetening either so the bar tastes good without being sickeningly sweet.On the downside, my bar is labeled \"Wild Blueberry.\" I didn\\'t taste very much in the way of blueberry. Dates, yes. Blueberry, not so much. Calling the bar \"Wild Date\" would be more accurate, though perhaps not as easy to market. Wild blueberries, if you\\'ve never spent part of your summer picking them in the woods, don\\'t have a great deal of taste. As kids, we used to take a big pile of them and eat them all at once because if you ate them one-at-a-time, it was like eating nothing.So overall, a fine snack product. I\\'d change the name to something more suitable, perhaps less blueberry oriented, but I\\'d leave the actual snack bar alone -- it\\'s just right. Getting a bunch of these to store in the car glove box would not be a bad idea at all.', u\"Pure's line of snack bars are tasty and somewhat nutritious, but I have a few hesitations from recommending them wholeheartedly:* Though I understand the benefits of eating raw foods, I have to question the advisability of manufacturing raw products for mass consumption.  There are so many points along the process where contaminants could be introduced, and in a product that is never heat treated, harmful bacteria could multiply unchecked and cause serious food poisoning (as seen in an unpasteurized, mass-produced line of apple juice a few years ago).  Organic products are not safe from this.  If Pure is taking any kind of measures to ensure the safety of its uncooked products, they haven't mentioned it.*  For 200 calories per bar, I'd really like a more substantial snack than the six grams of protein these bars offer.*  The texture is a little grittier than I like.My reservations about food poisoning will prevent me from buying these.  Otherwise, I likely would have bought them occasionally as a semi-healthy snack.\", u'These bars were rather flavorful for being a healthy product.  I would recommend these bars to anyone trying to eat healthier.', u\"I received one small bar through the Vine program. Opening the wrapper revealed an ugly looking brown mess. Throwing caution to the wind I took a bite. It tasted like I was eating a piece of cardboard with a barely detectable blueberry hint. This horrible tasting thing has 190 calories and a whole bushel of fat. No way could I take another bite. This ugly, calorie laden and fat enhanced glob is resting comfortably in my garbage can. Don't believe the hype.\", u'This is by far the best of the bunch where the Pure Bars are concerned. This one has a good balance of orange and cranberry with a not too sweet taste and nice texture. I like keeping one of these bars in my desk drawer at work for a quick and healthy pick-me-up if I need to work late.', u'These bars are GOOD!There, that should be all I need to say. However, in the interest of a fair review, I will continue. The bars are sweet with being cloying, and taste rather like a dampish fruit leather. The honest fruit flavors shine. They are the perfect size for an energy boost in your day, but are a bit small to use as breakfast bar. The only negative I could say is that they ARE damp and slightly sticky, requiring the prudent use of the wrapper to avoid seriously goopy fingers.A small price to pay for a delicious treat!', u\"I tell you what, the very first bite I didn't like the bar at all. The texture was odd and the flavor was odd too.By the end of the bar I was sold though. I've eaten other bars with much worse texture and plenty with worse flavor too. The thing about this bar is that, as I said, I liked the bar by the time I'd finished it. Not so with others where I didn't care for it from the first bite.Plenty of blueberry flavor and crunchy nuts with no bad aftertaste. The texture takes some getting used too but I think part of that is knowing what to expect. Kinda like taking a sip of tea when you expect coke. I don't eat organic food but I could appreciate the experience of feeling pretty close to nature with this bar. Sounds corny huh.Anyway, as an alternative to a candy bar it is excellent. Better in every way and not even super expensive compared to candy prices. I like the serving and a half of fruit you get too.Darin\", u'This bar was actually not as terrible as I thought it would be - I had tried another all natural fruit bar recently that tasted like a compost pile, so this was actually refreshing.  It should be called \"Pure Bar Organic Wild DATE\" because it tastes and has a texture like dried dates (which is fine, I like dried dates) with a hint of blueberry.  It does smell blueberry-ish though.  The first few bites were really good and I kept thinking that it reminded me of eating a fruit roll up... but maybe having 70 of them smashed together and eating it in one bite... a kids dream.  I didn\\'t like the nuts in the bar.  I probably would have preferred it if it was a fruit only bar, for some reason the nuts threw me off and I got about half way through and lost interest.  My husband had a few bites and also had a similar reaction.Not sure how much energy I\\'d derive from it compared to other food bars, but even as a processed packaged food, it tastes light years better than most of the other bars I\\'ve tried.', u\"The ingredients in this bar are organic and healthy.  The texture is a little odd: It's not dry and it doesn't have that cardboard characteristic a lot of organic foods have, but it is kind of sticky and gooey.  The sweetness from the fruit sugars in the bar is overpowering and a little cloying.  You can't even really taste the blueberry over all the other ingredients.  For an organic bar, though, it's quite good.  At 190 calories it's not quite a meal, so pairing it with something less sweet to make it a meal would be ideal.  The price is, unfortunately, a bit steep, even a little more than other organic bars I have seen locally.\", u\"Look, I appreciate healthy food as much as the next person, but this thing just wasn't that great.No weird chemical ingredients and not too heavy on the calories- not too bad!But it was a sort of grainy sort of chewy type consistency I just found a little gross.Tasted like blueberries, but in more of a subtle way. Like a fig newton- but I like fig newtons more.\", u'As you might be able to see I\\'m a Vine Voice member which means I get to sample products and then review them. I mention that not to brag but because Pure Bar was rather miserly with their sample size and I received a whopping one bar. With a product like this it can be difficult to make an accurate judgment, particularly on taste with just a single bar but I will try to do just that.It certainly wasn\\'t love at first bite. The \"Pure\" bar is rather dense and chewy with large chunks of nuts, dates and blue berries. My initial reaction was to compare it to a fruit cake and I am not a fan of fruit cakes. After a few more bites it started to grow on me but then it was done. In the end I would give the taste a good score. It\\'s not as tasty as a candy bar but it\\'s not advertised as a desert, it falls under the category of cereal bar. As a breakfast replacement it\\'s good for people on the go and I could definitely see it useful for travel and sports for a quick burst of energy.Where Pure Bar excels is in the ingredients and I\\'m willing to accept a less than staggeringly awesome taste given the fact that there are precisely zero chemicals and preservatives. Well, actually I\\'m not sure what Rice Protein Concentrate is but the rest is just dates, cashews, blue berries, walnuts, agave nectar and almonds. As the back of the bar says \"that\\'s all! Nothing cooked. Nothing processed. Completely PURE.\".Nearly $1.70 per bar is a little high but not killer. You can get a bit of mileage out of 190 calories and I figure there is an extra overhead to getting all organic ingredients with no preservatives. This price is marked down from $2.50 a bar and at that price I would take a pass. You could buy a decent meal of fruit from the grocery store for the price. I\\'ll give the makers credit for having their hearts in the right place and I think it\\'s a good product but it didn\\'t blow me away enough to get a full five stars.', u\"Ingredients:Organic Dates, Cashews, Organic Cherries, Organic Rice Protein, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds---and that's it!Considering the price of organics to make a quality product, I think the price is a deal!  The taste of cherries is not strong and overpowering, date is the prevailing flavor, the combination of ingredients is, in my opinion, a great mix for a good flavor without being too sweet.  For those who watch gluten, you will be happy to know this has none!  Also it has no--refined sugar, cholesterol, trans fat, preservatives, color or dairy.  I thinks it just nice to be able to have a decent tasting snack and feel good about it!  Hope you enjoy yours as much as I.  If you are really a stickler on ingredients their web-site is [...].\", u'This fruit and nut bar did not taste bad. More nutty than fruity. Certainly nothing that was hard to choke down.But the taste was not that good either. In fact, had it not been labeled \"wild blueberry,\" I would not have noticed any blueberry taste. Even knowing that taste was there, it was hard to pick out.If you believe the advertising on the packaging, these \"pure,\" \"organic,\" \"uncooked\" bars are as far from junk food as you can get. That\\'s good, I suppose.For me, though, I\\'ll stick to fruits, nuts and vegetables in their real unprocessed form. Like blueberries, almonds, apples, and the like. Better, I think, than these bars.', u\"These Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueerry bars are very good. They are a great pick me up, filled with fruit and nuts. Pefect afternoon snack. My kids even love them I can't keep them in stock at my house.\", u'Pure and effective!NTural, clean and works better than albuter!Works great every time you need to clear your airwa es', u\"Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar;  I am a vegan so I thought I'd like these bars and I did because of the cherries. My husband loves them too hence the four stars. These were very tasty. They are loaded with vitamins and minerals with protein. These bars are a healthy alternative to a candy. The cost if purchased on the subscribe and save method is not bad at $1.41 a bar.  I would say they are a bar to have as a fast meal if you are running late; however, I'd use them mostly as a mid-day pick me up snack. Because they are raw I would not keep them on my self long or in my car.There are many flavors to choose from. I recommend them and will definitely buy.\", u'I have tried the blueberry and the cherry and I found both to be tasty.  I like the fact they are organic and low in salt.  The nuts are a great addition.  I recommend this snack bar.', u'It\\'s impossible not to like the quality of this product. It\\'s organic, raw, gluten-free. It\\'s certified vegan and certified kosher.All natural and non-dairy (and completely uncooked). Low sodium with 400mg Omega 3 an d4 grams of fiber. (Of course, no refined sugar, no soy, preservatives, trans fats, cholesterol etc.And \"15 vitamins an minerals\"--plus anti-oxidants from cherries. Dietetically, it is worth 1-1 1/2 fruits Yes, if you\\'re looking for nutrition, you\\'d be better off eating a fruit). But if you\\'re looking for a SNACK, this is a great choice. It satisfied my sweet tooth without being very sweet--and felt like a much better choice than 99% of the usual \"snack foods\", mainly because it is raw and \"natural\" with great ingreients (see above) an a lack of processing.Taste? Well, that\\'s always subjective, but I liked it well enough. It wasn\\'t chewy--but almost. I defintely tasted the cashews (which I love). No sign of cherries for me, the overwhelming taste is kind of a processed date-fig base (even though it is UNprocessed and there are no figs). Especially at Amazon\\'s reduced price $19 for 12, the price isn\\'t bad, even though the product is smallish (about 6\"). I could see it being a nice mid-day snack with a cup of tea, staving off hunger even, as part of a diet plan.I liked it.', u\"My one son loves Think Organic bars but he would not eat these.  He didn't like them at all.  I ended up giving them to the snack pantry at school because no one at our house would eat them.\", u'I like to snack on energy or protein bars before going to the gym after work.  The protein bars in particular are for the most part quite gross, so I was looking forward to trying these purportedly healthy and hopefully decent-tasting bars.  The taste is not bad.  The bars are very sweet, and do taste vaguely of blue berries.  The appearance and texture is unappetizing though - little bits of nuts and fruit are suspended in a gooey chewy base, which is colored an unappealing brown.At 1.7 ounces this bar is not very substantial.  It would make a good light snack, but I still felt hungry afterward.  Despite the weird appearance and texture, this bar was perfectly edible, unlike some of its competitors.', u\"When I ordered this snack bar, I expected something likeNature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars, Fruit & Nut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12), something with lots of nuts and a little dried fruit. When I received the package and opened it, however, I found that it was the opposite: dried fruit with nuts mixed in. It looked like dark chocolate, only kind of waxy, not very appetizing. But looks aren't the most important part of a snack, so I bit in.And it wasn't very good. It had a tart, almost bitter taste. Tart is fine when there's another taste to complement it, but the only other flavor here was that cardboard-y, health-food taste. The consistency was pretty good, though-chewy, but not too chewy. And the bar does have a good shelf-life.The wrapper is pretty, but it's not bio-degradable, which I'm sure is important to a lot of organic food lovers.This snack is pretty good for you. All the materials are organic, nothing but dried fruit and nuts. It has a lot of antioxidants like omega3s. There are 17g of sugar, but it's all from the fruit, so it's better for you than products with added sugars. There're 8g of fat, .5g of saturated fat, and 190 calories. That's not bad, but I was hoping there would be some monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats in it. The snack bar is gluten free, dairy free, and vegen, and that's good. You get 3g of fiber, but there's not a whole lot more nutritive value. You can exchange the bar for 1.5 fruits.And honestly, I would do just that. Fruit sure tastes better, and if you choose the right fruit, more nutritious. There really aren't a lot of nuts in this, and I was hoping for more (that's what she said). I think an organic trail mix would be a better choice. This snack isn't bad for you, but honestly, the best thing about that is that you can eat something else later without feeling guilty.\", u\"I didn't expect to like this health food bar as much as I did, as I'm not a huge fan of cherry-flavored products, but was pleasantly surprised. According to the product page, it comes in a variety of other flavors, too, including wild blueberry, cranberry orange and chocolate.  It's low in calories but higher in fat than some health food bars I've had.  The taste of nuts and fruit was nicely meshed, and just one bar was enough to tide me over until dinner an hour later.  It reminded me of a Fruit Roll-up bar flavored oatmeal cookie. I would definitely recommend them.If I had one complaint, I would have preferred more than one to sample, but the amount isn't influencing my rating.\", u\"I was a bit scared of trying out something that is raw but this bar actually tasted pretty good.  The texture is like a fig newton and it smells nice. It's made from organic ingredients:  dates, cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, wild blueberries, apple juice concentrate, sunflower oil, agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, blueberry flavor.  Nothing is cooked or processed.It's also gluten-free and vegan.  One bar equals a full serving of fruit. It has 190 calories, 70 from fat, but that good fat from the nuts.  The nuts also provide a lot of Omega 3s. It has 19g. of sugar - that's more or less a teaspoon of sugar, but not the processed kind because it comes from the fruit. I'm a diabetic and I would recommend this product.  I would have liked  a touch of salt.  It has 0% sodium but some would have rounded off the taste and taken the edge off the sweetness.  I would also like more of the blueberry taste to come through.\", u'These tasted great. They reminded me of the Blueberry flavor Larabars I normally eat. When you look at the label you\\'re thinking \"Whoa! 190 calories! That\\'s like a hamburger\\'s worth!\". But, that\\'s a bit misleading as most of the calories consist of protein and natural fruit sugars. Trust me, this no plain ole candy bar being pitched as healthy. The heavy fiber content and vitamin combo will melt those calories right off. It\\'ll also clean your system and not just in some fancy New Age way.', u'It probably should be called a \"Cherry-Cashew\" flavored date bar.As far as an energy bar goes (which I like to enjoy before hitting the gym) this is a pretty clean and pure alternative, but not particularly high in protein. The taste was OK as compared to other energy bars I have tried, and I don\\'t have any food allergies that I am aware of, so I would not personally choose these over and above other bars. The current price does not seem too outrageous, if the shipping is free so the value is fair, if you really need a bar that has ingredients like this one has. The label states 1.7 ounces, 190 calories with 8g fat and 7g protein (its all those nuts) so it compares to other energy bars but with lower overall numbers because it is smaller.I wish that I had more of these to try and see how consistent they are and if they really help when you are exerting yourself but I only received one. I wish that I had enough to share with my family and friends to see how they like them, but I only received one. I wish that I had one to keep in my bag for when I am hungry and need a snack, but I only received one.However, they are not in the business of passing out free samples and I wish them good luck in their endeavors. At the time of this writing, you might note that their bars that have a very few reviews have many stars and the ones with many reviews have fewer stars. So, you can tell the products that have had more use by a wider range of people. I am sure that this company would want you to read the fine print and purposely eat foods that make a difference to your body and the world. I probably would not have picked this bar in a store to try. I liked the Probar FruitionPROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar, Strawberry 1.7-Ounce, 12-count Boxbars better.Again, in my opinion, this single bar I tried is not really good or really bad (based on the single bar I tried), hence an average rating. I would not choose these over the peanut butter (thank you G. W. Carver!) versions of my favorite brands Clif Bar (fairly clean and pure)Clif Bar Energy Bars, Crunchy Peanut Butter, 2.4-Ounce Bars 12 Count box ( Pack of 2 )or  Power Bar (not so pure and clean, but available)PowerBar Triple Threat Energy Bar, Caramel Peanut Fusion, 1.94-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)orPowerBar Performance The Original Energy Bar, Peanut Butter, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24).', u\"Tastes like a dense blueberry nutbread.  Real blueberry flavor and lots of it.  Pretty good, actually, as sampled by an 8 yr old, a 14 yr old, and two adults.  Everyone liked it.  Although th blueberry was a little overwhelming, the walnut came through, and the texture was pretty good also; like a dense nutbread rather than a sticky or taffy like protein bar.  I'd get it again, but in small amounts, as it would be easy to overdo the blueberry flavor.\", u'I actually bought a case before I got this bar from vine but had not left review, so this review is after getting from vine. The wild blueberry flavor is very strong, so if you love blueberry and nuts you will love this bar. The texture is similar to a chewy brownie with lots of almonds for crunch making it very filling. Wild blueberries  have higher ORAC (antioxidant power) values, and the blueberries are apple juice infused not sugar, so very healthy bar.I love to have one with a cup ofCafe Altura Organic Coffee, Sumatran Dark Roast, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag. Great for fast breakfast or sanck.', u\"I'll admit I'm not generally a healthy eater and don't have too many organic fruit bars, so I'm not sure what to compare this with. However, I thought it was pretty good. It's a bit like a soft granola bar - you can taste the grains, without the crunch. However, for me at least, the cherry flavor wasn't very strong. I love anything cherry (I drink cherry-flavored seltzer regularly), and thought this bar had more of a strawberry-cashew flavor. Still tasty nonetheless.\", u\"I was surprised by how much I liked this bar. Dense, chewy and just the right amount of tartness completely hit the spot. It's not filling enough for a meal, but as a snack I'd definitely use it for a mid-afternoon craving instead of a candy bar. It's not as healthy as advertised, both the calorie and fat content are higher than I'd prefer but I feel it's a decent alternative to what's usually stocked in the local vending machine.\", u\"The Organic Wild Blueberry Pure Bar is a filling snack that is a good source of both fiber and protein.  As indicated  by the name, all the ingredients are organic, and additionally, all the ingredients are also raw.  The taste is mostly nutty, with the combination of walnuts, cashews, and almonds overpowering the blueberries quite a bit.  I often find that snack bars, especially those with nuts, are difficult to chew, but this bar is fairly soft and easy to eat.  I would eat this product again, but I do wish it tasted more like blueberries.  I'd recommend it to nut-lovers.\", u\"This is like a grown-up version of the fruit roll-up.  It has good flavor and is organic.  I would say more fruity than specifically cherry.  The cashew pieces are finely chopped.  I would have liked them to be bigger and crunchier.  You could say it's a healthy snack and is if you need something tidy and packaged.  A piece of fresh fruit with nuts or nut butter would be a better choice.  But this is good for throwing in a back pack or other bag.\", u'I give it 3 stars for all the great things they put in, and all the bad things they take out.Like Castor oil, this is GOOD FOR YOU!Unlike Castor oil, it does not taste bad.  But, on the other hand, the flavor is not compelling, either.  Or, put another way, for me, a \"regular\" non-vegan non-organic eater (yes, I eat some organic food, but I also eat cows and pigs and eggs), these bars do not turn on my taste buds.If you are really looking for something really GOOD for you, where the taste is not a primary concern (of course you don\\'t want something that tastes BAD, and these do not taste bad), then perhaps these are for you!For me, my mother might have given them to me, along with Tiger\\'s Milk, and I would have dumped them in the trash when she was not looking (just like I dumped the Tiger\\'s Milk - with Castor Oil and lots of other GREAT stuff that really tasted horrible) down the drain whenever I got the chance.Oh, I am BAD!  But hey, if you are vegan or an organic food \"nut\" these are probably just right for you!', u'The blueberry Pure organic bar was delicious. It\\'s a very moist bar as it is packed with plenty of fruit and nuts, which made it very easy to eat. While I\\'m not particularly into organic foods and the fad surrounding it, somebody who is will probably go ga-ga for this bar, whose package lists these ingredients: \"Certified Organic Ingredients: Organic dates, organic cashews, organic walnuts, organic rice protein concentrate, organic wild blueberries (with organic apple concentrates and organic sunflower oil), organic agave nectar, organic almonds, organic lemon juice concentrate, organic blueberry flavor and that\\'s all!\" Well, okay then. To be honest, I couldn\\'t identify each nut because the moistness of the bar won out over the crunchiness of the individual nuts. Overall, the bar was satisfying enough, but I am not sure if it\\'s worth it to consume 190 calories (with 70 calories of fat) from this tiny bar. It\\'s good but not great.', u'This bar may have simple ingredients, but I could not deal with the taste (not sweet enough for me).  Also, the texture was as though the nuts and fruits were just pressed together as opposed to the consistent chewy texture of other bars.', u\"Considering how healthy The Pure Organic Raw fruit and nut bar is, it tastes great. The flavor isn't too strong, but not bland either. This is definitely the kind of bar you want to have stashed in your desk at work or at home when you need a quick snack but don't want the nastiness of a chocolate candy bar. For anyone on a raw diet, for vegans, for those on a gluten free diet - this is the perfect snack bar.The main point of a review like this is to let those who haven't tried it know how it tastes. You can see ingredients and other specs online. So I will say it again: The taste is good. It's not the best tasting thing I've ever had, but it's good for what it is. 10 years ago, you would never get this much taste from a raw, organic, gluten free product.Good job, Veronica (she is on the front of the wrapper). She did a great job with this product.\", u\"These are delicious and tastes healthy enough to make sure you don't feel guity about consuming them.\", u'This bar is a substantial and satisfying snack.  It has a thick, chewy texture, is sweet but not overly so and very nicely flavored.  A great trail refreshment, or good alternative for snacking between meals.', u\"I am both surprised and impressed with the quality, taste, texture of the Pure organic cherry bar.  Not only is it made from organic ingredients, but in proportions I have not found yet.  It is mostly fruit!  I was expecting something like a granola bar and am surprised to have found something different.  There is no added sugar, no bulk fillers.  The bar is almost entirely fruit and nuts, with fruit making up the largest part.What you might not know without reading the label, is that the main ingredient is dates.  This works.  The dates have enough sugar, and the right texture to hold everything together.  I'd say this is about the most wholesome packaged product I have tried to date, and one I'd be happy to slip in my kids' lunch box or back pack.\", u\"I love anything made with blueberries, so I had to try these bars. They have a delicious blueberry, date and walnut taste and are so natural, they taste much better than other health bars I've tried. Like the name says, they are PURE. The ingredients are organic, they're raw and they have no added sugar or other fillers. They're also vegan and gluten free which is great for people with dietary concerns. I like these bars as a healthy snack in between meals. They're filling and a easy way to get an extra serving of fruit and protein into your diet.\", u'I am a raw vegan with a heavy load of health issues, including Celiac Disease and food allergies. I but rarely eat commercially prepared snack/nutritional bars because typically they don\\'t meet my dietary requirements. I much prefer the nutritional bars I prepare myself but being chronically ill and disabled, I don\\'t always feel well enough to go through the effort. But living in hurricane country on the Gulf coast of Florida, I do like to have some kind of food bar on hand in my hurricane pantry along with my other emergency supplies.I was excited to findPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and have not been disappointed in the least. First of all, PURE meets all my dietary requirements for food bars: it must be organic; it must be raw; it must be vegan; it must be gluten free; it must not contain GMOs, preservatives, soy, refined sugar or trans fat; it must taste good.These chocolate brownie bars are the best! I agree 100% with reviewer Tennyson E. Stead who stated so well that these are the \"closest thing I\\'ve ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.\"  Really!  A brownie doesn\\'t get better than this! The Pure Bars are small but dense and quite satisfying although I could easily eat two at a time. They are moist, chewy, naturally sweet and have no added sodium. The chocolate is rich and not compromised by carob, the fruits are flavorful and sweet, the nuts fresh tasting. All the flavors are bright and nicely balanced without a trace of rancidity or moldiness, a problem I\\'ve experienced with other bars, particularly Larabar.The Pure Bar label is easy to read and contains all the nutritional information I like to see. I\\'m happy too that PURE Bar is certified organic and a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I am definitely going to stock up onPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)on a regular basis because I indulge in them often, not just during hurricane season! Amazon\\'s Subscribe and Save Program is THE way to go too!  I am also signed up forPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)andPure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)which are also wonderful.  But hands down,Pure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)is my favorite and I love it best!', u'This is not a granola bar, as I expected. The texture is somewhere between banana bread and fudge. It is moist, dense, sticky, and somewhat grainy. The least appealing aspect of this bar to me is the calorie and fat content: a bar the size of a credit card, only 1/8\" thick, carries 190 calories, 70 from fat. If you are hiking the Appalachian trail, that might be a plus. But for a quick pick-me-up, this is too many calories for too little taste.', u'My husband keeps these at work in case he has to stay later.  They are a good pick-me-up and satisfy him for a while longer.He is the one who keeps asking me to order them so I set them up on Subscribe and Save to make it easier and a better price.', u\"This bar is all raw fruits and nuts with a little brown rice thrown in as a binder.  The first ingredient on the label is organic dates and that is mostly what I tasted.  There are bits of the tart cherry flavor but not enough to really notice.  Visually, the bar is not terribly appealing.  It looks like a rectangle of mashed dates with small white bits of macadamia nut. If you are into raw foods or on a vegan diet, it's a nice ready to go snack alternative.  The taste wasn't bad but it's not something that I would choose if I had another option.  (Of course, this is from someone who's used to eating regular granola bars with all the sugar and unpronounceable ingredients on the label.)  For nutritional value and wholesomeness, I would give this 5 stars and the taste wasn't bad but it wasn't the kind of thing I'd reach for when I want a snack.\", u\"The larger percentage of the ingredients in these bars seems to be the fruit, but it is not extremely sweet. The texture reminds me of a thick fruit-roll up with some nuts and other ingredients pressed in to it. The flavor is just okay.  I wouldn't buy them for their flavor but I would if I really needed a fast and healthy gluten-free snack handy.\", u\"I really liked this wild blueberry bar and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is not as good as the cherry cashew bar. One cannot go wrong with raw/organic. I don't normally purchase this kind of thing, but I will certainly purchase these as snacks in the future. I also think they are a nice, healthy option for young kids.\", u'I was certainly glad to find that I had stuck my Pure Bar in my jacket pocket on a recent flight, when the only other offerings keeping me from starvation were airplane peanuts, so this review is definitely right-leaning in its bias. After not having had breakfast, this little bar of blueberryness made everything right with the world. It\\'s certified vegan, Kosher, and organic (\"no artificial nothin\\'\"), no gluten, no trans fats, and it fills up the corners. Because of all its pluses, I would buy it again; on the side of fairness, however, it has the same amount of calories most bars of its type have, and while it is good, it doesn\\'t knock itself out of the park. Shortly put, it\\'s satisfying, and fills the needs of many who need to watch their intake of certain ingredients.', u\"I was expecting a traditional cherry flavoring used in typical candy or granola bars. However, this bar had a different taste. The cherry flavoring has a bit less kick as it is not a sugary fruit snack, but it also tastes closer to the cherries in a cherry pie. I presume this is due to the cherries being thoroughly cooked before used in the production of this bar.The cashews are still crunchy, but the walnuts are really showing through. They are the dominant nut in this bar.These Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are quite dense. They remind me of protein bars and other bars made to stave off hunger. As dense as these little guys are, they should keep you going for a while before you need to eat. Excellent for those who might not have time to eat, but need something to help them get through the day.With the density, moistness and organic ingredients, these guys do not seem like they will last too long in your pantry. I wouldn't stock up on them, but rather order them periodically so you keep a fresh supply. Other than that, they taste great and are awfully good to eat!\", u'I wasn\\'t sure if Pure Organic Raw Fruit and Nut Barwould be predominantly fruit or bar but it\\'s definitely a \"bar\" with an almost brownie-like consistency, flavored primarily with cherry and cashews. A bite and a glance at the label further revealed dates, walnuts and almonds - a rich, complex taste that will have you guessing. (If nothing else buy it to stand up to the Nut Police who want to eliminate all traces from their perfectly safe world - but I digress...)The bar\\'s texture is chewy but not sticky to the teeth. The cherry flavor is subtle at first bite, a black cherry that\\'s deeply aromatic once it kicks in. The cashew bits are more like slivers and somewhat lost in the mix. I would have preferred  more substantial pieces, halves or quarters to add cashew flavor and give a little more \"mouth feel\" as they say on those foodie programs.The description says \"Low Sodium\" and salt is not listed but I have to say part of my initial reaction was \"a bit salty\" - not sure where that came from, soy perhaps?Solid foil wrap that feels secure and a drawing of creator Veronica on the label, what more could you ask. (Imagine we all had to submit to having our pictures attached to our daily work!).Nice treat. I\\'d definitely eat another.', u\"I have a gluten intolerance and was going on a bunch of extrenous hikes and needed some fast protein but had never purchased any GF protein bars.  I went off of reviews of others who had these before and absolutely love them.  They are tasty, flavorful, and provided a boost of energy when I needed it in the hikes.  If you have a gluten issue and want a delicious tasting protein bar definitely go with these.  Since it's a varitey pack you get to try different types of the Pure bars and see which one you like the best.  Personally I liked all of them.\", u'While hiking on Santa Rosa Island in Channel Islands National Park, my wife and I tried this new bar.  What a gem.  Hiking bars tend to by dry and often include an overkill of sugar.  This bar, on the other hand is at once moist and filling.  The insistance on using all organic ingredients will undoubtedly raise the price, but the flavor is worth it.My only concern is that sometimes, after a product becomes popular, manufacturers will substitute less expensive ingredients.  And I do expect this bar to become popular.', u'I love chocolate but not all the sugar & unnecessary ingredients in regular brownies or chocolate bars. This bar is perfect since it is made of healthy ingredients. I really enjoy the taste and how moist and chewy it is. The price is right too!', u'they sure made this for the health concisous..taste good to me, others found it OK...gotta try it', u\"The Pure organic bar is a very good alternative to other nutrition/energy bars.  It has a very good taste that isn't chalky, dry, or tough.  The texture is more like fig newton bar and not overly sweet. This is definitely something I will consider keeping in my backpack for travel or just daily nourishment.  While some people may think the bar is a little small (feels about half the weight of a cliff bar) I think it's a good size for a snack on the road or trails that takes the edge off but won;t make you feel stuffed. There is no obvious indications of storage recommendations or a freshness date, so it should be fine to keep these in a bag for at least a few weeks.Looking at the label, each bar is 190 calories, 8g of fat (.5g saturated) with no transfat or cholesterol.  One thing that some people wold appreciate is that this bar is certified USDA organic(all items are listed as organic), is  vegan and gluten free.I will definitely have to consider Pure bars in the future\", u'I really should state a disclaimer first - I\\'m a huge fan of sweets.  So, while the taste of this bar is fine I still found myself looking for a sweetness.Having said that the bar was very satisfying and surely much healthier for me than my usual grab for chocolate.  It is a rather small bar that really can be consumed in 3 - 4 generous bites.I was very pleased with the ingredients ( as was the person with whom I shared it. )  And while the label states that the bar might contain \"Pieces of nuts, shells, stems, pits\" - there were none in mine.We\\'ll be ordering some of these as I continue to try to wean myself away from the \"super sweets\" with high fat content.', u'I have no clue why some have rated these 1 star, they are delicious! Not dry and not slimy either. I took the 12 variety pack to Yosemite in both cold and very hot weather. They did not melt and did not get slimy at all. The taste is high quality in every bar. These are one of the few bars that are vegan, raw, organic and gluten free. They have full size nut and fruit pieces inside! You will not be disappointed.', u'A day of tedium in the office and an intense hunger in my stomach made me yearn for satisfaction. There was my lunch, yes... but I wasn\\'t quite ready for the smorgasbord I had prepared for myself; the yogurt, banana and left over soft taco salad would have to wait their turn. Reaching through the dark pangs of subtle hunger, I found the solid hope to fend off the deluge of Tex-Mex that awaited for me later in the day.The shiny package caught my eye like an oasis of city parks in an urban desert. I carefully opened it so as to not disturb the goodness that waited inside. The specimen of organic fruits, nuts and juices looked to be dense. Wariness gripped my heart as I thought of all the other energy and health bars I\\'ve battled with in the past. Oh, how I yearned for a fruit filled cereal bar in that moment if only to sway me from what I expected to be a bland and grainy experience.But then...a surprise.The bar, an elusive prize, was flavorful. Distinct fruits could be picked out. It was a thing to be enjoyed... no... savored at a slow pace. My bites were smaller than normal if only to imagine this very \"snack,\" to be a full blown meal. While there were similarities of look and texture to other similar \"fruit and nut\" bars, the experience allowed for a complete re-interpretation of how energy bar should be. To those other products, a metaphysical crisis loomed: what is it to be? To what end shall existence be perceived?I did not believe that the insanity of this alternate universe could grow further until I discovered, under the nutrition facts, that this delectable delight contained no sodium.I could only mutter \"what?\"', u'I love to eat real, simple, unprocessed foods, and I loved the ingredients in this bar - no filler rice krispies, agave-sweetened, dates, nuts, fruit! But since it\\'s cashew cherry, I expected to taste cashews and cherries. I was surprised that it tasted almost primarily of dates, and the only chunks of nuts I got were very obviously walnuts! It should be called \"date and walnut bar with hint of cherry flavor\", because that is what I experienced.It was a reasonably tasty bar and didn\\'t give me a weird sugar rush like Luna bars and that ilk do, but it didn\\'t leave me feeling healthy and nourished afterwards, either. It felt like I\\'d eaten something mildly wicked, but it didn\\'t taste so great that I felt like I\\'d really gotten to eat something decadent, so it kind of wasn\\'t worth it.Your taste may be different, so if you\\'re impressed by the ingredients, then go ahead and try one. Just keep in mind there are more dates and walnuts in here than cherries or cashews.', u'Personally, I like a \"regular\" granola bar much better.  This doesn\\'t look appetizing. .  .and quite frankly, it doesn\\'t taste all that good.  Perhaps this is just too \"sophisticated\" for me.  It sounds so good, but it\\'s just kind of \"yucky\" in your mouth and you want to swallow as soon as possible.', u'If you like a moist, brownie-like energy bar, that tastes more of nuts than blueberries,  this is the one for you.  It is very filling, with about 200 calories and about 1/3 fat calories, so a great post-work out boost.  Because it is soft and moist, it may end up getting squashed, so I would recommend to handle them with care.  Not a bad price for a bar with the organic ingredients.', u'While I like the fact that this bar has organic ingredients, I won\\'t buy it because it has Agave as the main sweetener. Agave is pure fructose at 93% versus High fructose corn syrup. Agave is a \"fake healthy\" sweetener.', u\"I'm quite fond of cherries and cashews, and combining them worked out just fine! These are nice to keep around when I'm traveling or even just running errands, as an alternative to various fast foods and snack foods out there. They're really just raw fruit (dried, of course) mixed with nuts and packaged for easy storage and use. Very tasty and very easy! Oh, and I never even noticed that they were low in sodium; there was too much flavor for me to care about that.\", u\"Well Cherry and Cashew hmmm sounds good right? Well mostly it's not either of these and has a high calorie, carb, and sugar content. I could live with that if it tasted better, sadly it just does not. For that high a calorie content, sugar content and carb content, I could have a nice dark organic chocolate bar with no added sugar that would be much healthier. It was not the worst thing I ever ate but not all that good either. I would not recommend it, or buy it if I was looking for something of this nature. It sure looked good, unfortunately in the taste department it fails, and as far as healthy its not all that.\", u\"I have tried many healthy snacks and this is definitely one of my favorites.  It has a cakey-like texture, but fruity with pieces of nuts and only slightly sweet.  It is sweetened with natural agave nectar.  This bar has all organic natural ingredients and it's also gluten-free.  Great for vegan and raw diets too.190 calories per bar25 grams carbs3 grams of fiber220 mg of potassium\", u\"This is my first time trying PURE fruit and nut bar.  I don't know what I was expecting, maybe the taste of a regular trail mix bar.  It's hard to describe what the PURE bar (blueberry flavor) tastes like, but it's not an unpleasant flavor.  The fruity flavor is obvious, and the nuts do not overwhelm the tastebuds.  I like that the bar is soft and chewy, and not too sweet.  Also, it's made out of all natural and organic ingredients, with nothing processed.  That to me is worth having a bar that doesn't have the conventional taste of other energy bars.  The taste is not bad, but it's not delicious either.  However, the bar is filling and doesn't make you feel guilty about eating it, because the ingredients are so healthy.I would recommend these bars as snacks, but they do have plenty of calories, so I wouldn't eat too many of them at once.  But that's true of any kind of snack.\", u\"This is one of the first Organic, healthy fruit bars that I liked.It doesn't dissolve in your mouth, feel gummy, or as hard as a rock, if that makes any sense!Has a great taste also.It was easy to give this bar 5 stars.You could see the berries, seeds, nuts etc in this bar.I'm impressed that it's, Organic, Gluten free, soy free, dairy free, and non gmo .I have not seen any bars that can say this.It doesn't seem to have been prosessed as much as other bars are.I think it has 190 cals.I did read the ings before eating it, and could not find anythingunhealthy about it.It didn't seem like a very big bar to me! I would keep these in my purse, and car for apick me up.I would buy these bars if I didn't have to buy the whole box.The Con is, I could eat more then one!Two thumbs up..\", u\"The bar is in itself rather small, and you could see yourself eating two of them just to kill your hunger but on wouldn't do much for me (at 200lbs).  It has almost a nothing flavor with a hint of 'berry' aftertaste but not much of anything during the eating.  Whether everything in it being 'raw' as opposed to cooked or 'processed' doesn't mean much to me or I would guess the average person.  This is really a product for the 'nutritionally conscience' of people who are concerned about everything they put into their body.  Even then I'm not sure that it is that much of any improvement over other 'organic' bars.One thing that did strike me was the claim that 'nothing cooked or processed'.  I just wonder as to the definition of the word processed.  You have to do something to put the bar together.  You don't just lay out the ingredients and they then crawl together on their own waiting to be cut into the right size.  Also, two of the ingredients are concentrated fruit juice.  Isn't concentration of juice a 'process'?  or do they just leave the juice out in the sun and let the water evaporate away naturally?  You decide, it's not really that important to me but I like to see truth in the production of things even if it just this little truth.Zeb Kantrowitz\", u'When I saw \"Brownie Bar,\" I wondered what kind of flour it had, since it is also listed as gluten free.  There is no flour.  Yet you\\'d think you were eating a chewy brownie.  Nutritionally it\\'s very good without the use of anything artificial.  While I rated another gluten free bar a very high \"4,\" I\\'d have to give this one a full \"5\" rating.  One very slight caution: I have not personally experienced this, but my wife noticed that these tended to produce some \"lower GI\" problems for her - kind of a laxative effect, to be polite.  I\\'ve personally not had any difficulties, so we\\'ll continue to order them for me.  I can see where the ingredients might possibly cause such an effect in some, but doubt it would be an issue for most people.  And I can also say that she was quite disappointed at her reaction to the bars because she loved them!  I try to reserve a \"5\" rating for the best of the best, and this product gets the full \"5.\"', u'These are very good and healthy bars. Raw, certified organic and gluten free. They can be compared to Larabars, but have more than 6 ingredients. Strictly speaking I would give the edge to Larabars as being more \"pure\" because they pack so much real flavor without any added flavorings like this bar has, but these bars have nothing chemical in them either. These are moist and sweet, but it doesn\\'t overpower you. The blueberry flavor isn\\'t in your face, but you can tell it\\'s blueberry. Yes, the bar is ugly. But it\\'s ugly because it\\'s not full of artificial colors that make it look like something not found in nature.One thing I did enjoy more about Pure bars over Larabars is the texture. They have bits of whole nuts that overall give the bar a more substantial taste and feel. I would recommend these to anyone who wants an alternative and fresh tasting fruit and nut bar for a quick meal or snack. And at less than 200 calories it would be great for both.', u\"The color of the bar isn't appetizing; however, the taste is pleasant though a little too nutty for my preference.  I have organic products in the past...and well...this definitely superior to those..this one actually tasted good....many of the others left a cardboard sensation with a nasty medicinal aftertaste.  This one did not.  No added sugar as far as I can tell.  The kids didn't like it because it wasn't sweet enough...but isn't that the point of being organic...getting away from processed sugars and stuff.\", u\"I am a huge fan of this product, but only the Cherry Cashew flavor. I tried the Wild Blueberry and it did not taste near as good as the former. It's still much better than much of the junk that passes as nutritional bars so that is why I give it three stars. Does not taste like cardboard/sawdust and really reflects it's classification as a raw fruit and nut bar. 6 grams of protein on this one versus 7 grams for the Cherry Cashew and they both have 190 calories. This is a great in between meals snack and I can only speak for myself but I'd stay away from this flavor and try Cherry Cashew.\", u\"This isn't bad for a gluten-free berry bar.  A bit on the sweet side, but crunchy and satisfying.  Good fruit taste.  I find that most fruit bars are pretty addictive and don't serve to quell your appetite- this one does a better job than most due to the raw nuts.\", u'I got to say this product is so tasty and just sweet enough. This is a excellent and healthy snack.', u'Over the past few weeks, I have been trying to eat healthier foods and things that are \"real food\" versus the snacky stuff I tend to grab when hungry and in a hurry.  When I was given the opportunty to try an organic bar that looked full of fruit and nuts, I leapt at the chance.This raw fruit and nut bar is labelled \"Charry Cashew\" and I think that is misleading.  I tasted very little cherry flavor and the cashews weren\\'t strong either.  What I did taste was dates and walnuts -- pretty different that I was expecting based upon the packaging.The bar itself is very dark (the color of dates) and the texture is very sticky (like a date) and very chewy (like dates) -- are you noticing a theme here?  While much better for you than many of the over processed, sugary granola bars, I was actually disappointed in the nutrients -- everything was in the 4% - 6% range for the required daily value.  Better than 0%, but not as good as I had hoped.Bottom line:  Not terrible, and I ate the entire bar without a problem, but not particulary good either.  Not a product I will be running out to purchase.', u'I have been a long time fan of the Pure brand. Their bars have no nonsense in them and it is easy to see what is in the bar, no secret or hard to decipher ingredients.The taste is really good, not just this bar, all of their bars I have tried and really enjoy. They have a good texture, and a nice weight to them. It takes a bit longer to eat than the average  soy based bar and leaves me satisfied quite a bit longer.Kids like these bars too, they have a nice sweet taste to them and kids look forward to eating part of a bar as a snack.Absolutely try these bars!', u'My two favorite things, cherries and cashews! Unfortunately, I could have a candy bar instead of this 190 calorie bar. The smell is not enticing and the taste is flat. Not sweet, not salty.... just blah.', u'The \"yummy\" part of my review is probably self-evident...the \"well-balanced,\" however, doesn\\'t so much mean that this is a well-balanced part of your diet, but rather that the components are well-balanced to make this scrumptious- not too sweet, not too tart.The consistency of this bar surprised me, as it\\'s moist and fudgy. The natural flavors of cherry and cashew complement each other very well and, as I mentioned before, it seems like real care went into matching the ingredients so that the final result doesn\\'t taste like a candy bar (and that\\'s a GOOD thing)!One bar (1.7 ounces) makes for a substantial treat or meal on the go...especially when matched with a cup of hot coffee (admittedly, your tastes may vary). Recommended!', u'You know by the taste that \"Pure\" Organic Raw Fruit and Nut Bar is good for you!  This bar satisfies hunger and keeps you feeling full for quite awhile.  For people on-the-go who have little time to stop for lunch, this bar is quite sufficient in providing the nutrients you need to keep plugging along during the day.', u\"These bars are tasty and filling. We like the variety and the texture of the bars. Eating them slow ensures your 'full meter' in your tummy kicks in and you don't overeat.\", u'This is a very pleasant tasting snack bar.  It is mild in taste and texture.  I think because it\\'s so natural and relies on natural sugar rather than a heap of processed sugar, it just doesn\\'t have a bold, over-the-top taste like other foods we are all used to.  But that\\'s a good thing, because this bar is actually good for you.I agree with another review that likens this bar to a fig newton.  It definitely has a prominant fig taste, with a nice hint of blueberry.  I noticed the blueberry taste got stronger as I ate the bar.  The texture of the nuts is a little bit crunchy, but very easy to chew.  This is definitely not like a trail mix bar.The only thing this bar has going against it is its diminutive size (3.5\" x 2\"), and it\\'s price.  Health food made from good quality ingredients is expensive to make, so this should be no surprise.  I just know that personally I would never spend 20 clams on 12 small bars like this....but then I\\'m not a complete health food nut like some people are so I think there is definitely a market for this product.', u'pure bar chocolate brownie is a great gluten free bar. it does taste like a brownie and the ingredients are fresh and simple. i tried all their flavors and keep going back to this one.', u\"The main problem with the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, is that it doesn't taste like cherry or Cashew.It's made of just a few assorted nuts and a few assorted fruits rolled into a bar. And I'm not sure exactly what it tastes like. it's like one bar of flavor confusion. I can't tell what it tastes like.Maybe I would have liked it better had it actually tasted like cherry and/or cashew\", u\"These were absolutely awesome.  I have tasted them in both flavors and both are delicious.  Don't taste chalky like some and packed with fruit and nuts.  I go through them like Sherman through Atlanta. Very good.\", u'I tried the wild blueberry organic pure bar.  It was okay.  The smell was overwhelmingly blueberry - almost synthetic smelling - but I checked and the product is all natural and all organic.  Our household is a Lara Bar household so it was interesting to compare this to our normal fare.  The PURE bar is very greasy, which I thought was kind of weird.  The taste was okay.  Not great.  There were nice chunks of nuts, much bigger than you would find in a Lara bar.  I definitely won\\'t change brands, but it is nice to know that there are other options out there if you find yourself in a place that doesn\\'t carry the Lara Bar.  You do have to know that these types of bars have plenty of fat, nuts and thus calories in them, a bit under 2 ounces and a bit under 200 calories.  They are much denser than your regular run-of-the-mill granola or fiber bar and they are definitely \"healthy\" tasting.  All in all, just okay.  I\\'m sticking with Lara Bars.', u\"I really enjoyed it.  It's soft and has a nice cherry after-taste which lingers in your mouth.  Despite being nutty it doesn't crumble when you bite it so it's not messy to eat.  And, best of all, it's not too sweet.This tastes much better than the health bars we normally buy as those can be quite sweet and messy to eat.I recommend this.\", u\"Surprisingly tasty without the sickeningly sweet taste of many other snack bars. I expected dry and tasteless but was pleasantly surprised to find it moist and flavorful.  Similar in taste to a Fruit or Fig Newton without the extra sugar, salt, nonessentials, and unhealthy ingredients. The all natural unrefined ingredients were a refreshing change from so many other over-processed bars that load up on sugar, salt, and chocolate to make them appealing. At the same time this bar is extremely filling without that spiked hungry feeling half an hour later that leaves you wanting more.  The most enjoyable thing about this bar is that you can taste the real blueberries. The dates, nuts, and other natural organic ingredients in this bar are noticeable but they don't seem to detract in any way from the blueberry flavor.Although high in calories (190 per bar), it has 0g of sodium, 3 g of fiber, 19g sugar 6g protein, making it a well within reason as a nutritious snack for someone who lives a healthy active lifestyle. I believe these bars would be great for anyone wishing to improve eating habits to include more natural and wholesome ingredients, or prefers organic foods to more processed and refined snacks, and perfect for Vegetarians and Vegans alike. But this bar might be a little too high in calories to be considered a weight-loss snack bar and possibly lacking in enough essential nutrients to be a full meal replacement.  Overall, I think it makes a healthy nutritious snack and is well worth the extra money it might cost over some of the competition, especially when considering it is organic and vegan friendly.\", u\"The Pure Cherry-Cashew bar was a fine granola/energy bar but there was not much about it that set it apart from every other granola/energy bar on the market.  I liked it and would have one again, but it is not something I'd go out of my way or spend much extra money on.  Overall, it was okay but not remarkable.\", u\"Considering the ingredients, I'd rather snack on a mix of high quality dried cherries and nuts than on a bar that is mostly dates (note: dates are listed 1st in the ingredient list, with cherries 3rd). Dates are a fine fruit, but for a bar named Cherry Cashew, I expect, well,  cherries & cashews!Though the flavor was OK, the crunch of nuts was totally lost in the heavy, chewy mixture that was the basis for the bar.The pre-packaged bars are definitely convenient (grab and go). Still, for my money, I'd prefer buying dried fruit & fresh nuts in bulk, mixing up a batch to my taste, then storing in small reusable containers  to throw in the lunch bag or purse during the week.\", u'I received this bar not expecting much, and I was quite pleasantly surprised. So many bars of this nature (gluten-free, protein-powder-added type bars) has a distinctly \"vitamin-y\" smell and flavor. These do not. The cherry could certainly be more pronounced, but then I think that about every single fruit-containing bar I have ever eaten. So that may just be my sweet tooth acting up.Pretty good nutritionally speaking...super low sodium, good healthy nut fats, fruit, etc. Good amount of dietary fiber. Slightly high in sugar, but not terribly so.The other thing I liked was the texture. Chewy and moist, not gritty and chalky like you may expect. It would be great as solid food for a long bicycle ride.The only thing that puts me off at all is the expense. A little higher than I\\'m comfortable paying on a regular basis, but that\\'s all about how much value you place on the product and how much extra cash you happen to have, so YMMV.', u'It\\'s interesting to see the spread of reviews on these bars - personally, I think if you\\'re used to eating healthy breakfast bars (like Kashi), you\\'ll probably enjoy these too. Obviously, being completely organic and full of everything that\\'s good for you, it can feel there\\'s something \"absent\" (i.e. everything that\\'s not good for you), so I don\\'t imagine this would necessarily be a big hit with kids and teens.Still, my wife and I shared the Amazon Vine sample today and really enjoyed it. As others have pointed out, at $2 a piece they\\'re a little pricey, but that\\'s cost of eating well - we\\'ll definitely be ordering a box to keep on standby for when we miss breakfast or lunch.', u\"These were okay and edible, but I wasn't overly thrilled.  Also, I thought it had too much sugar for something that is supposed to be considered healthy, and not enough protein.  At over $1.50 per bar I think there are other bars more worthwhile and healthy to pick up.\", u\"This is a great little bar with healthy ingredients. If they would cut down the sugars by about 30% and increase the oats by a like amount, I'd rate it a 5. Still, one of the best I've found.\", u'I\\'m a big fan of blueberries and this bar does not do them justice. From the product description, \"We specifically choose apple juice-infused (not sugar-infused) wild blueberries to avoid refined sugars\", which is a shame because blueberries are naturally sweet. The texture is similar to a Fig Newton, slightly chunkier, but still not appetizing for me.For the nitpickers out there, they also claim the product is gluten, soy and dairy free, but then state it is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish and tree nuts. Oh well, I suppose in our \"economies of scale\" world maybe it\\'s impossible to produce items without having them contaminated by unrelated ingredients and the hyper-sensitive part of our society dictates these have to be called out. Too bad. I think I\\'ll stick to dried blueberries and a bag of granola which are both healthier, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than this bar.', u'My experiences with health and energy bars have been mixed. Most of the ones I\\'ve tried are pricey, taste terrible, and make me feel like I\\'ve swallowed powdered cement. So, I was cautious about Pure Bar. My general view, based on experience, is that the healthier and more \"organic\" it is, the worse it\\'s going to be and this one is jam-packed with things like organic dates, organic cashews, organic rice protein concentrate, and other organic healthy stuff--so it couldn\\'t possibly be delicious, right? Wrong. I was pleasantly surprised after the first bite hit my taste buds. These things are really good! Unlike most health bars I\\'ve tried, these are chewy and moist--not hard and dry. I don\\'t have to wash this down with a drink in order to get it from my throat to my stomach, and there\\'s no nasty aftertaste. And, the price is definitely reasonable! I\\'ll be buying more of these for sure.', u'I have to admit, I was hesitant that this would be yet another very bad tasting \"healthy\" bar but after reading the ingredients as all organic, i decided to give it a try.  I couldn\\'t really taste the blueberry, but it had a decent nutty flavor and not as \"ick\" as other bars I\\'ve tried.  it\\'s not over loaded with sugar and ingredients that I can\\'t even pronounce, which is a huge plus in my book!I like that it is gluten free and all organic.  it\\'s a decent, healthy snack to keep in my desk drawer at work for those afternoon hunger pangs.  that and a bottle of water are a nice healthy snack.', u\"When I look at the bar it seems normal sized, but when I open it and see how large it really is, it seems slightly smaller than other bars.  I take a bite and the first thing I notice is the nutty flavor, with a hint of blueberry aftertaste.  The bar itself is soft and ever so slightly sticky, but not sticky enough to be messy.  This bar is very densely packed material.  Not crumbly or flakey.I appreciate the fact that this is all organic and very healthy and that nothing is cooked and processed.  But I wonder how they deal with e-coli and the like.  E-Coli is found on plants and in animals.  The bar clearly states that it isn't processed or cooked.  I know there have been E-Coli scares with raw juices and spinach and other produce so I do wonder how they try and prevent it in their product.The flavor has a weird sweetness to it.  Maybe that is the nature of unprocessed food!  I don't eat a lot of organic food and the only raw food I eat is plain fruits and veggies.  When I bake I tend to pile on the sugar or honey in some cases for sweetness, so that is the flavor I am accustomed to.So for me this bar is not a good match, if I were to buy a fruit bar (which I don't do often) I'd probably stick to good ol' Nutragrain which has a flavor somehow more familiar.  But I think for someone is are ultra careful about what they ingest or for someone who only eats raw food this would be an ideal choice.  Actually, if I were part of the raw food movement, I'd tout this bar as a fast convenient snack.\", u'This bar was really very good. No frills or fillers, just cherries and dates and few other wholesome ingredients. The cherry flavor is intense and true. The cashews add some protein to help balance out the fruit sugars. I thought it sublime.', u'I love blueberries - anything with blueberries! I was not sure how this would taste when I ordered it from the Vine program, but I was pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite.  It tasted like wild blueberries and nuts - not like cardborad with mysterious flavorings and sawdust on top being passed off as something edible.  I wished I had several more to look forward eating - guess I will have to buy a 12 pack!', u\"These are nice and tasty.  Very Orange zesty flavored so if you don't like the flavor of orange zest these certainly aren't for you.  It really over powers the other flavors but as i like the flavor these are a winner.\", u\"I adore the taste of cherries and nuts -- this is just the perfect combination. It has all the healthy components I look for in a snack, without any of the garbage pumped into ordinary snack bars. The tartness and texture are just right. It's hard to believe how mellow the sweetness is.The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew Bar is absolutely great. You've got to try it!\", u\"As a new mom, I'm often left 'snacking' my meals away throughout the day. This usually means a lot of food in 'bar' form. Given that fact, I prefer eating things that are as tasty as they are healthy.In comparing the Cherry Cashew bar to its Wild Blueberry cousin, it's hands down tastier. I also found the consistency more appealing.At 190 calories for this bar with its mix of nutrient percentages, I'd still say that Cliff bars have an advantage from a shear sustenance standpoint, but I did like the taste of this bar.Overall, good taste, good bar.\", u\"I have tried all flavors of this brand now, and blueberry is quite good (still in love with cherry and the trailmix, and the apple, and heck, the blueberry (I love them all!))This bar has a nice amazing taste to it, very succulent.I love eating organic bars, and many of them are hit and miss as far as taste and nutrients go.My staple protein bar is the organic protein bar (made by another company) that has a pretty decent taste, but full of nutrients.For fun, I like to mix things up with very tasty organic bars, and wow, did I find a winner here.The Organic bar is phenomenal, has this amazingly wondrous taste that fills my mouth with countless flavors, as I slowly sit back and eat and take each bite in slow wonderment.I can't get enough of this bar, and I hope they continue making them for a very long time.The beautiful thing is, thanks to amazon's subscribe and save I never have to be without them again. The price is very good too, so good I have no problem ordering 2 boxes a month and have this bar me my main staple.This bar is nothing but amazing and I can't recommend it enough.Perfect for early mornings before a run (or after), or during the day when you're too busy to fix a salad or eat something healthy, or just as a healthy snack when reading a book or watching a movie.5 stars all the way, couldn't be happier nor more impressed.\", u\"As snack bars go this one is pretty good.  I've had some flavor combos that just didn't work for me in snack bars.  But this cherry cashew is a nice mixture.  I'm big on snacks that combine sweet and savory (usually of the junk food variety).  This snack bar is definitely in the sweet/savory category.  It's sweet but not overly so.  And has just enough saltiness to balance the flavor.  It's a good alternative snack to fend off hunger in between meals without feeding the vending machine at work.  You can feel good about eating these since they are healthy.\", u'The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar is a tasty snack that much healthier for you than a vending machine candy bar.  Just keep in mind that this is organic, but *not* a diet food.The first ingredient is dates, and in fact the overall flavor is that of dates, with a subtle hint of cherries, and nuts.  There is also a bit of \"sawdust\" consistency to the bar, not sure if this is from the ground nuts or the organic rice protein.  I enjoyed the flavor of this bar; the dates and cherries make a fine combination.It\\'s not sweet compared to a candy bar, but there is enough natural sugar in it from the dates, cherries, and agave nectar to total 17 grams of sugar in a bar.  There is also 8 grams of fat from the ground cashews, walnuts, and almonds.  Though certainly healthier than standard candy bars, these still have to be considered a fairly high calorie \"treat\" and not a diet food.In all, I really did like the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar; I received a free sample for the purposes of this review, but would happily buy a box of these in the future.', u'I am an active, health conscious individual who is always trying to shed a few pounds.  I eat an early dinner around 5:00 P.M.  Sometimes, I don\\'t climb into bed for another six hours.  At that late hour, I am normally hungry again.  Instead of eating junk food, I try to eat something healthy such as a bowl of high fiber cereal with nuts, a cup of yogurt, a bowl of grits or a small can of fruit.  I\\'m always looking for healthy alternatives for snacking.  However, some health bars taste horrible.  I was very excited to try the 1.7 ounce cherry cashew organic bar from PURE.All the ingredients are organic.  There are no preservatives or refined sugars.  This small, sticky bar is approximately 3 1/4\" long X 1 5/8\" wide X 7/16\" thick.  It has 190 calories, 70 of which come from fat.  I have scanned and posted the wrapper which shows the nutrition facts, allergy statement, ingredients, expiration date, web site and healthy reasons for purchasing the bar.Tonight, before going to bed, I ate the cherry cashew organic bar with a glass of cold soy milk.  Its bountiful supply of dried fruit (cherries and dates) and nuts (cashews, walnuts and almonds) gives it a chewy texture.  It has a deliciously tart cherry taste.  In this bar, I could definitely taste the cherries.  The wild blueberry bar from PURE had a more mild taste; I couldn\\'t really taste the blueberries.  These bars remind me of fruit cakes, the type I eat at Christmas.  When going to bed, instead of a plate of cookies, eat one or two of these PURE bars with a glass of soy milk.  I say two because it will be difficult to only eat just one.Joseph B. Hoyos', u\"FLAVOR:While eating the bar, I could definitely taste the cherries.  While I could feel the bits of cashew, I didn't taste them until after...there's definitely a lingering flavor of cashew after you're done.  The cherries were delicious, and they really tasted like cherries, not like cherry flavoring.  Every bite tasted like a cherry, though it was balanced with a neutral flavor that kept it from being overwhelming.TEXTURE:The outside of the bar is sticky.  The bar itself, as you bite into it, feels firm and chewy.  There are nut bits distributed throughout which give a little bit of extra firmness.SIZE:The bar itself is around 3 inches long and around an inch wide.  It's a little more than a quarter of an inch thick.SATISFACTION:I used this bar as a breakfast bar, and it kept me feeling reasonably satisfied for ~4 hours, which is about all I ask of a breakfast bar.NUTRITION:I'm no expert in this area, but I do like that this bar has no refined sugar and has a good amount of protein.  I've been trying to find tasty bars that have protein for the morning, and this is one of the first I've found.  I also appreciate that it's only 190 calories, versus the 220+ that many other bars give.OVERALL:Overall, I'm going to be buying a few packs of these in different flavors as soon as I finish this review.  I'm really glad I got the opportunity to try it, and I definitely recommend it if you like fruity and chewy bars and are looking for a high protein breakfast alternative.\", u'This is a really great tasting raw food bar... filled with nuts, dates, and fruit, the Pure bar has a nice texture (not crumbly) and an enjoyable taste.  Pure bars will be right up there with Larabars as raw organic food bars that taste great, come in a variety of flavors, and bring whole food nourishment.  The only noticeable caveat for those who are supersensitive with foods is that these are processed in a facility that also makes non-vegan food products.', u'It was a nice surprise to bite into a dehydrated raw food bar that didn\\'t taste entirely like almonds and dates with a hint of \"flavoring\". This Wild Blueberry bar actually tasted like wild blueberries!It reminded both of us of those fig bars we used to have as kids that had different flavors, one being some blue goo resembling a blueberry mash.Overall, a very satisfying bar in both taste and consistency.', u\"I'm a picky eater when it comes to the texture of food so nutrition bars have always been problematic for me.  They often have the consistency of sawdust rolled in butcher paper.Not so Pure Bar's product.  It has a consistency very similar to a fig newton, which is quite pleasant.The blueberry flavor is pronounced but not overpowering and the nuts provide a nice contrast.The only downside is it's not very big and has a slightly greasy consistency.Not something I could eat every day, but in a pinch or on a hike a good snack bar.\", u'Organic blueberry fruit and not bar.  Tasted very good.This organic blueberry bar is a very good alternative to many other nutrition/energy bars. The taste is good and similar to a fig newton bar.  It is not overly sweet. However, the bar is somewhat small.  From the label, each bar is 190 calories, 8g of fat.  There is no transfat or cholesterol. The bar is certified USDA organic(all items are listed as organic), is vegan and gluten free.', u\"Well, I was excited about trying this product especially since I like cherries and cashews.  When it arrived, I opened it up and took a bit (it arrived about mid-afternoon). I caught a little cherry flavor then cashew at first but it disappeared quickly and the next bit didn't help either. Sorry, but this is not very appetizing to my palette. I choose my caloric intake carefully and this just doesn't come up to a positive for me.  Maybe another combination might do it!I would suggest a little more cherry flavor and that possibly through adding additional sweetner to the mix.  The crunch, the cashews are just fine but the lack of continuing flavor not good.\", u'I wasn\\'t interested in a health supplement, or energy bar.  I picked this as a snack food.  It was very chewy and the individual flavors were strong and not too sweet - which was a good thing.  They didn\\'t skimp on the cherries or cashews, and the bar was a decent size too.  However, as odd as it sounds, I didn\\'t care for it because it tasted, well, raw.  I don\\'t feel the flavors blended well - it tasted like I had eaten a handful of the various ingredients together (like trail mix) with flavorless gum holding them together.  For those who care about appearances, the bar may not look appetizing.  It is very dark, almost black.Overall, I think (like many \"organic\" foods) that it is way overpriced for what you get.  At nearly $2 a bar with the Amazon discount, it is pricey.  There are other reasonably healthy alternatives for those just looking for a snack.  For those looking for an alternative energy bar - it\\'ll come down to taste and nutrition.', u\"I am the first to admit that health food is not my thing.  I'd take a Snickers over the Cherry Cashew Pure Bar any day of the week.  However, the Pure Bar was much more tasty than I expected.Weighing in at 190 calories, I would not classify this bar as diet food.  What I did find interesting about the Pure Bar is that it is not cooked or processed according to the wrapper.  The bar is slightly sticky, but definitely not messy.  The texture reminds me of an oatmeal bar, it is firm and chewy.  The bar definitely has a date flavor.  Personally, I found the tart cherries being the dominant flavor.Overall, the bar did have a subtly sweet, pleasing flavor.  At first bite, I thought the tartness of the cherries was quite excessive, but I quickly got used to it.One thing I did not like about this bar was the lack of crunch given the amount of nuts in it.  I expected more of a crunch to it, but the nuts seemed to be chopped up pretty well and there really is not a nice crunch to give a variety to the texture.Overall, I was quite pleased with this bar.  I think it would be an excellent choice for hiking or any endurance activity where carbs and protein would help provide long-term energy.  To be honest, while I still like my Snickers, I think this would be a decent tasting alternative that is much healthier and less calories.\", u'I know it often takes some time for changed to be incorporated on product descriptions here, even after companies have submitted them, so I\\'m hopeful that it\\'s just an unintentional lag. The current label has different ingredients and claims from the product description. Here\\'s what it says:Certified Organic Ingredients: Organic dates, organic cashews, organic walnuts, organic rice protein concentrate, organic wild blueberries (with organic apple juice concentrate and organic sunflower oil), organic agave nectar, organic almonds, organic lemon juice concentrate, organic blueberry flavor.It also now says it has a \"full serving fruit\" instead of the one-and-a-half serving claimed in the product description here, so it looks like the fruit content has gone down in the reformulation of this product. Too bad. Other things to be aware of: 19g of sugar, 3g fiber, 26g of carbs.Taste is, of course, such a subjective thing. I like this flavor. I can taste the blueberries and the dates. The texture rates \"so-so\" to me-- I prefer the texture of rice bars, granola bars, etc. better-- a crunchier and lighter texture. These bars are solid and smooth with just a little bit of nutty crunch. Luckily, they\\'re not heavy and chewy like so many protein bars.All in all, I don\\'t love the texture enough to reach for it very often, but I appreciate the organic ingredients and the health benefits and hope this company will continue producing other healthy snacks.', u'I love organic food for myself and family.  This is a great bar.  Tastes good, good for you.  A good way to get your fruit and fiber for the day.  Highly recommend.', u\"It's sweet enough, but not overly sweet with a strong tart cherry flavor.It is more like a dried fruit bar with only a few nuts.  I thought it would be more of a nut bar with dried cherries, but if you are looking for a fruit bar, it's good.Whether or not you want to eat a 200 calorie bar is your own choice, but this tastes good, so I gave it 4 stars.\", u'These taste like a healthy nutra grain bar without all the junk. These r my fav followed by the apple & the orange', u'I can\\'t say this is gross and I can\\'t say it\\'s awesome.  It LOOKS nasty but I took that first bite anyway.  I don\\'t like the texture but I do like the cashews.  There are cherries in it and they\\'re yummy.  I gave my 11 year old son a bite and he said \"ewww\".  My opinion of it is that it\\'s just okay.  The price is too high and there\\'s no way I would buy these, but it\\'d be great for people who are into this kind of thing.', u\"I guess this bar is healthy...it has good ingredients. Not enough of any of the ingredients to get a good dose of what makes those ingredients healthy, however. For your nearly 200 calories you get almost no vitamins or minerals to speak of. There are nice chunks of nuts, but since they aren't toasted first they don't have that flavorful crunchiness. (And yes, I get that toasting would make this a NON-raw food, as if being raw is necessarily worthwhile, anyway.) The bar is just bland with some vague blueberry taste. Just brownish-purple gumminess with little pieces of dried blueberry and big pieces of raw nuts. It may have 6 grams of protein, but 190 calories aren't going to sustain you for long, regardless. My teenage son (who eats anything)took one bite and handed it right back. Frankly, if I'm going to throw away 200 calories on what basically amounts to an empty calorie snack, I'll find something more appealing.\", u'This bar has great blueberry flavor.  My problem with the bar is that its texture was much like a soggy, dense blueberry waffle.  I had my wife, 5 year old son, and 2 year old daughter try it as well so that I could get the full range of ages and tastes and it had similar effect.  My wife thought it was okay but wouldn\\'t eat more of them.  My son, well, his response was \"more! more! more!!!\" And finally my daughter put it in her mouth and spit it right back out saying, \"no like\".  So there you have it!  As far as nutrition bars go, they are slightly better than Power Bar but not near as good as Clif bars.', u\"If you insist on an all-natural organic snack bar, you might like this Cherry Cashew PureBar.It has a bit more flavor than the Pure blueberry bar and a nice texture, with no unpleasant aftertaste.  I give the flavor a B or B+.Is it worth $1.50 a bar?  That seems pretty steep to me, but I'm on a fixed income these days.If you can afford one of these little brown bombers, you might enjoy it.  At least it doesn't seem to contain anything suspect or harmful...\", u'The first and occasional taste of real blue berry made me keep trying another bite, but each time I did I became less satisfied with the bar. I was hoping that it would have been more like the KIND Fruit plus Nut Bar, which has a very satisfying taste and texture, but instead it was more like a chewy gooey unidentifiable powerbar with some nuts and fruit added. If you like the normal powerbar goo (which I do not), then this could be a good fit for you as the addition of the fruit and nuts could make it more interesting. It definitely felt like it would fill you up for the 190 calories, but I like to enjoy the food I it as well.', u'The first thing I look at with just about any food product is ingredients, and there\\'s nothing to worry about here on the label: dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein concentrate, walnuts, agave nectar, almonds (in that order).  That\\'s it.  *All* are organic (and the product is USDA certified Organic on the label).  Interestingly, the ingredients listed on the package differ from what\\'s listed in the Amazon listing.  I assume the \"rice protein concentrate\" is to add some additional protein.  The size is about typical for these kinds of energy bars (pretty small), and the price is astronomical for the amount of food you get, but not too much more than a clif or powerbar from the supermarket.  Anyway, this particular product is kinda like a Clif bar, but easier to chew (not hard).  Taste is okay... very natural, and not bad at all.  Certainly not a bad product to pick up for special occasions (workouts, etc), but I don\\'t think I\\'ll be incorporating these into my everyday routine, they\\'re too expensive for my budget.Some of the Nutrition facts (1 bar serving): 190 calories, 70 fat calories, 8g fat, 25g carbohydrates, 3g fiber, 17g sugars, 7g protein', u'These bars are fantastic!  Very tasty with a great consistency. They are better tasting than Lara Bars, another raw food bar. Being raw - they fill you up and keep you feeling more satisfied than other sugar filled bars with cooked ingredients.  GREAT product!', u'These bars are wonderful! The cherry flavor is powerful and the texture is just right. I will be buying more of these bars. If only they were bigger!', u'Cherries and cashews are in my top five list of favorite foods!  This is a nicely done energy bar that is not too sweet.  The cherries and cashews are large pieces, not chopped to death like in many other energy bars.This is the best I have ever tasted, and best in texture and quality.  I would definitely order more to take with us for camping and hiking trips.Highly recommend.', u'As a vegetarian who is always looking for a good snackbar or meal on the go bar that has some protein in it,and if its organic thats even better.  I was thrilled to see this on the Vine newsletter. I have\\'t seen this in a store and anxiously waited to try it out.One reviewer said it was too \"wet\".. It IS moist but not bad. I love Soyjoy and those are as dry as month old fruitcake. The moistness of the Blueberry Pure bar is a refreshing change.The taste of this bar isn\\'t bad IMHO, its just not filled with sugar or chemicals.  It tastes like nuts and blueberries, exactly what it is.  I quite enjoyed it actually,but then again I can eat lettuce with nothing on it and enjoy it. If you are used to sugar filled bars like Luna bars then this will probably disappoint your palate.I can\\'t wait to get a box of these and try out some of the other flavors too.', u\"Usually organic snack bars sound good, but leave a lot to be desired.  The Pure Bar - Organic Cherry Cashew, tastes exactly like it sounds.  There are big chunks of cashew nuts and a bright, tart cherry flavor throughout.  The conistency is almost like fruit leather aside from the nuts, except as you chew it, the texture changes into something more akin to dirt.  So these aren't perfect, but they are perfectly delicious...and healthy, so 5 stars!\", u'The ingredients listed on the wrapper of my Pure Organic Wild Blueberry bar differ substantially from the list on the Amazon page (though, in fairness, the listing says that ingredients may vary--but this much??). Here\\'s what it says on Amazon today:\"Organic Dates, Organic Wild Blueberries (With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Canola Oil), Organic Cashews, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Lemon Juice Concentrate.\"Here\\'s what I got, as listed on the wrapper:\"Organic Dates; Organic Cashews; Organic Walnuts; Organic Rice Protein Concentrate; Organic Wild Blueberries (With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Sunflower Oil), Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds, Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate; Organic Blueberry Flavor and that\\'s all!\"That\\'s a HUGE difference.For me, the main problem is walnuts, though. Although I\\'m not allergic, I have a sensitivity to walnuts that causes slight irritation in the mouth and an associated bitter taste. So, that\\'s strike one, but that\\'s just me. Just sayin\\'.I just don\\'t get a satisfying flavor and texture from this snack. The date texture comes through in the slight gumminess, but there\\'s really no berry or even fruity sweetness or tanginess there. The cashew/walnut mixture makes for an overwhelming, much nuttier flavor and texture than I had expected with a product highlighted as a blueberry snack. I\\'ll take a pass on this one.', u'\"It tastes like a blueberry fig newton,\" my wife said.Different kinds of nuts dominate the bar. There\\'s a slew of organic ingredients and the wrapper is almost boastful. It tastes...okay. Bitter, but not too bitter. It\\'s hard to imagine anyone truly devouring it though. Imagine NutriGrain with the packed/raw flavor intensified.', u\"After now having tried two of the PURE organic bars, they're starting to grow on me. This flavor, cherry, is definitely better than the blueberry one I'd tried earlier. That being said, it still isn't the most delicious fruit/nut bar I've tried, and is far from being there. I realize it's healthier for you, but, for me, taste has a big part to do with it. It's not like I want to eat cardboard, for instance.In the end, it's really not bad. If you're looking for something healthy, that tastes a little better than cardboard, you've got your bar. Otherwise, maybe look at special K and other bars for something more tasty.\", u\"Great tasting and good ingredients. The only problem with the bars is that they're not exactly low calerie, but they're also not very filling.\", u'The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew fruit and nut bar is a refreshing alternative to sugarry snacks. It is not meant to be a meal replacement bar, or a fruit snack confection but does have some attributes of each.It contains the vitamins and minerals of fruit, the protein and crunchiness of nuts.It is more moist than meal bars, has no added sugar and natural flavors.Camparing it to the Pre blueberry bar, the cherry bar has a more subtle fruit flavor.', u\"To be honest , I wasn't expecting much. Usually , these types of products are bland and tasteless. Happy to say that this was an exception. Very flavorful and left you wanting to buy more.\", u\"This product may not be appealing in terms of looks, but it's delicious!  If you've enjoyed Fruit Bars such as Larabar or Fruition, you're familiar with this style of energy-bar-like product.I haven't tried all the flavors, but I can say that the combination of cherry and cashews is delicious.  Enjoy!\", u'The packaging is great and looks attractive.  I had tried the blueberry bar first and was underwhelmed.  I liked the cherry better.  It was sweeter and less bland than the blueberry variety.  As with the blueberry, the toddler liked it.  A good, healthy snack when on the go.', u'I liked it - it has an unusual blueberry taste mixed with dates and nuts.  I had it for my breakfast today.', u'- Bar tastes decent, not dry like Clif bars or dense like power bars.- It has the consistency of a pureed packed solid.- The nuts are crushed so one cannot really tell whether they are cashews.- Though it says it includes Blueberry, it was difficult to really taste the blueberry flavor. The taste of date is very evident.- This is by no means a bad bar. I think Boomi Bars are both healthy and more enjoyable overall. Boomi bars tend to look like raw ingredients pressed together. Whole nuts are easily identifiable, as are the grains. Also Boomi bars have far more creative selection of bar flavors.', u'I know how hard it can be to stand in the grocery store and read a label to try to figure out exactly the ingredients in a product.  The Pure company has solved that problem for you by listing both what is and what isn\\'t in this fruit and nut bar.  Sometimes what isn\\'t there can be even more important than what is there.  For anyone on a medically restricted diet caused by allergies, this product will be good news because it contains absolutely no gluten, dairy or soy products.  Additionally, it contains no preservatives of any kind.The bar is approximately 3\" x 1.75\" with an indentation down the middle for easy halving.  The full bar contains 190 calories according to the label.  I enjoyed my bar with a cup of hot tea and it really was quite good.  In fact, I was rather surprised at how much I liked it.  The cherries were completely recognizable and had that tart/sweet taste of raw fruit, I could taste the dates, and pieces of nuts were plainly visible.  The bar was rather sticky which is probably to be expected of a raw, compressed food, but it wasn\\'t so much of a problem that it would cause me to refrain from buying this product.  The label says to watch out for pieces of nut (well it is a nut bar), shells, stems or pits.  Luckily I missed any of the unwanted bits.', u\"I was recently diagnosed as being gluten intolerant.  I have had some HORRENDOUS tasting gluten free energy/breakfast bars.  Since I could try this for free, I decided to give it a shot.  I was very pleased.  I'd eat these bars even if they were not gluten free.\", u'I was somewhat disappointed in the PURE Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar.  Yes, it\\'s a very \"health-wise\" product, and yes, it\\'s nice that all these natural ingredients come in a convenient, portable form.But I found the bar\\'s somewhat dry and mealy texture to be fairly unappetizing.  Nor did I care much for the flavor, which was fairly bland but left a slightly bitter, sour aftertaste.  This product is a poor substitute for a serving of fresh organic fruit and raw nuts, and I cannot in all good conscience recommend it to anyone who values taste over content.', u\"And the unusual thing is that it is full of natural ingredients as well. No HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup), thank goodness and no artificial preservatives. This is truly an all natural, organic and good tasting snack bar that won't play havoc with your blood sugar, has no cholesterol and no trans fats. Placing my order today for another dozen.\", u\"A very good and tasty bar and also all natural.  It is also wheat and gluten free.  I can't help but compare it to the Larabar though, which is very similar and about 40% cheaper.  One thing to be aware of with any of these natural fruit and nut bars is they have a lot of calories and fat.  That said, the fat is from the nuts, so it is monounsaturated (i.e. it is a healthy fat).  Nevertheless, these are not for someone dieting but rather a natural energy bar for those with active lifestyles.I based my 5 start rating on taste alone but if you factor in cost, I'd have to knock it down to 4 or even 3.  Larabar is every bit as good and natural for about a buck a bar, while these bars are closer to two bucks a bar.\", u'This tastes very lightly sweet and gently tart from the cherries and pleasant nutty from the cashews.  My only complaint is that it was processed in a plant that processes peanuts.  About 1% of the population is allergic to peanuts and this becomes a product for them to avoid.  Very sad because I really enjoyed this bar and wanted to be able to buy some and share them with family but cannot.', u\"My initial impression was that this bar has the essence of Fig Newtons. The base texture is soft and dense and tastes of dates. The chopped nuts add a nice amount of crunchiness, which is assuaged by the chewiness of dried blueberries. It's not very sweet, which I don't mind, but I felt like something was missing (salt?) - the flavor never moved past the middle of my tongue. I'd sum up the flavor by saying that it was inoffensive.While I understand the convenience of having an individually-wrapped bar in your bag, I would rather eat a handful of nuts and dried fruit - it certainly tastes better, is closer to a raw and unprocessed food, has less impact on the environment, and costs less.\", u\"As a Vine Reviewer I received only one of these. It tastes predominently of blueberries and walnuts. No unpleasant aftertaste. How it will hold up after being in a pack several days in the heat, I can't predict. Yo'll have to compare, side-by-side, with similar products to determine which gives you more nutrition for the buck.\", u\"If you are a vegetarian you'll like these. If you eat a lot of natural foods like grains, vegetables, nuts, etc. .  you will like the taste and texture. I you like that fake high sugar and chemical taste of most of the protein bars out there,  . . which I don't, . . you won't like these. These are for people who like real food and don't need 8 tablespoons of sugar for something to taste good.These are great to take along with you so that you'll always have something healthy to eat. Being a vegetarian, it is very hard to find food that isn't garbage (when you're not home) because 90% of most food is. All the people at work eat the junk from the vending machine and buy sodas. I can now bring these to work and have them available if I feel I need to eat something.Thanks to Pure for creating these!\", u'I\\'ve only had a chance to eat one of thesePure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)bars, so my commentary is limited to the one experience.  My first reaction was that it\\'s like eating a bar of the stuff that you find in a Fig Newton(R) but I mean that in a good way.  It\\'s just the pure flavor, and no cookie on the outside.  The Blueberry was not too tart or too sweet.  The mixture of blueberries and nuts tasted good to me.  My wife had a small byte too and felt it was, OK (she would have rated it lower).  Since there is no cookie covering, the bar is sticky.I got a kick out of the contents -- they listed about 11 (eleven!) different \"Organic\" ingredients, with Blueberry being the 5th.  I would take this bar on a hike when I needed a boost of energy and calories, but at 190 calories per bar I would not just snack on a few of these while watching TV.Caution, there is an allergy warning on the wrapper, for cashews, walnuts, almonds, and it\\'s produced in a facility where other allergens are used, including soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, and tree nuts.', u'If you need a healthy meal you can carry conveniently, these bars are a very good choice.  The ingredients are all organic real foods:\"Organic Dates, Organic Cashews, Organic Cherries, Organic Rice Protein, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds.\"They claim \"nothing cooked, nothing processed\".  This is a refreshing change from our world of modern processed foods.  And yet it\\'s nicely packaged to provide us the convenience of something easy to carry and eat on the run.Each bar is 190 calories so whether you consider it a snack or a small meal, it\\'s a nice bundle of nutrition.So many other \"energy bars\" or \"nutrition bars\" are unhealthy junk food, it\\'s nice to see a company produce something I feel good eating.', u'This is as fresh as it gets. A very healthy snack that is pure fruit and nut. and 100% organic and it taste absolutely delicious. This makes a wonderful snack or part of any meal or can even be used as a dessert.I would suggest getting this by the case. Best bar, bar none. (Maybe not protein wise, but healthy nonetheless.)', u'There are a lot of these \"bars\\' out there that claim to be healthy, but when you get to the ingredients, one of the first few item is some form of processed sugar.  Either cane sugar, high fructose corn syrup, rice syrup, etc.  I was very pleased to see that this bar contained none of these.  There was nothing in the ingredients that caused me concern.Ok, so much for the ingredients... how does it taste.  I\\'m pleased to report that they are very tasty.  Dates are the first ingredient and you can definitely taste them.  However, these bars have a nice blend of flavors  and pleasing texture. I enjoyed them will probably buy moreI can definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a healthy snack bar.', u\"OK, so you want an energy bar without SOY, GMO, FRUCTOSE and all of the other crap the big food companies load their &#34;Protein Bars&#34; and &#34;Energy Bars&#34; with?  Well, you just found it.  Costco doesn't carry these yet, but we liked them so much we put them on repeat delivery.  This bar is quite a bit sweeter than the coconut bar, but an excellent thing to bring on a hike or grab when you need something extra.  It could be improved by adding some vegetables to it, which would make it more expensive but more healthy as a meal supplement too.  Products like this could kickstart a huge business for Amazon because they solve a problem for people who are trying to eat healthy while maintaining an active life style.  Older kids will appreciate this bar, younger kids may find the flavor a bit &#34;different&#34; from what they are used to eating - totally adulterated food - but they will quickly get used to it!\", u\"Tasty describes many food products and PURE is one of them.  The only problem is do not eat one on an empty stomach and expect to be full.  The 1.7 ounces are just too few for me to fully satisfy a sweet tooth.  The combination of nuts, fruits and goodies made a decently tasting bar.  It amazes me that they packed 170 calories into a 1.7 ounce bar but it's there.  I was lucky when getting ready to eat the bar in that I had a napkin handy.  If not, it would have been a stick mess especially had I planned to eat it on the go in the car.  I will pass on the significance of Organic.  I seldom purposely eat organic; however, it it there when available and for the most part organic is overpriced, tasteless products.  PURE is not tasteless.  It does leave a continuing and lingering aftertaste that lasts for about 4 to 5 hours.  After eating one bar I honestly could not say it will be added to the grocery list.  After eating several I might not like it as much as now and I may like them enough to consider buying more.  Right now, the jury is out or at the least taking a PURE break.\", u\"I was just about sworn off trying another one of these nutrition/healthy snack items because except for Nature's Path and Clif--and now Pure--I've found all of them to be made of healthy stuff glued together and dipped in at least five kinds of sugar.  Pure got it right.You can eat the Pure Bar without thinking a regular candy bar may have been the healthier choice.  Bring a couple to work--one for mid-morning and another for mid-afternoon--to keep that little nagging bit of wanting for something from distracting your brain.  It's great desk jockey food--perhaps even better than popcorn (other than plain).It's brain food, it's healthy, and despite all the claims of the innumerable 'nutrition' and 'healthy snack' foods competing for your attention out there the Pure Bar is one of the handful of items that actually is healthy and can be eaten guilt free.I'll even go so far as to say, it would be difficult to have fallen off the wagon by eating a few more of these in a day than you intended and have it really set you back in your weight management and loss goals.  Some foods, like the Pure Bar, are fine to pig out on once in a while.\", u'You hear raw organic, all natural, and you start to think \"this is probably going to taste like drywall.\" These bars, I\\'m pleased to report, taste a lot better than that. In fact, they taste so good I\\'m not sure I believe the ingredients list. My only, very minor, complaint is that there isn\\'t all that much blueberry flavor. This makes sense, given that blueberries are rather low on the ingredients list, and nuts are at the top. (Why is it that the front of a package usually lists the ingredients in the reverse order of the back?) To me, the bar tastes more like dates than blueberries, but I\\'m not complaining at all about the taste, just wish they\\'d be more honest about the description.One thing I really liked about the bars is that they aren\\'t too sweet; just right. I don\\'t know why most companies think Americans will only eat things sugared to the point of being nearly flammable, but these guys get it. Unlike many other companies in this space, they didn\\'t load the bar with grape juice concentrate to boost the sweetness. I hope they are successful. If so, perhaps if they are other companies will follow in their footsteps.', u'If you\\'re into fruit/snack bars plus natural and organic foods, I think you\\'ll find this enjoyable. If you\\'re not into natural foods, you probably won\\'t. I gave some to my wife and two sons. My wife thought it was nice, as did my elder son (age 8). My younger son (6) took a taste and handed the rest back. Probably because it wasn\\'t too sweet.Probably the best way to describe the taste would be \"mild\". The cherry and cashew flavors are obvious, but not blatant. It\\'s not excessively sweet, either, because there\\'s no refined sugar used. Personally, I liked it. If you\\'re used to sugared foods and fruit bars, it will probably take some time to get used to the flavor.The bar itself is rather chewy, but not in a sticky sort of way. I also thought it was slightly on the dry side. My elder son thought the same: a tad dry.This is not a nutrition bar. It has very little of the bad stuff: 5 mg Sodium, no cholesterol, no saturated or trans. fats. There\\'s also a nice assortment of vitamins and minerals in small amounts (4%-6% daily value). So while it\\'s not going to load you up on a lot of bad stuff, it\\'s not providing a significant amount of required nutrients, either. Eat this as a snack, not as a meal replacement.', u\"A good basic protein bar.  Not a bad cherry flavor and a decent, sort of peanut-butter texture.  Not a bad thing to have around if you want to nosh on something but don't want all the calories and sugars of a regular candy bar.\", u'Have tried all of the flavors love them all ,if I had to pick a least favorite it would be the cherry.The rest are just great. I have one for breakfast with my coffee.Then mid morning I have a piece of fruit. Very satisfying.Will buy again and again.', u\"I don't know if it was the weird, acrid aftertaste of something the resembled blueberries the way blue Gatorade resembles blueberries, or the dry, choking mealiness of a bar that nevertheless left my fingers sticky, but I'm just not at all a fan of this bar. If there were nuts in it, I never noticed, although that may explain the thin wafers I had to prod out of my gums afterwards.\", u'Tasty, raw, and portable.Pure is a brand I know and enjoy. This is another in a long line of great tasting products from this terrific company.I recommend it for folks trying to get kids to eat better snacks.', u'Our family has enjoyed the Lara Bar line of nutritional snack bars, and the Pure bars are similar to them -- \"raw\" food that is essentially pureed fruit and nuts. Since we deal with Celiac in our family, finding a gluten-free snack bar that has no added sugar is a plus -- most snack bars contain gluten and are loaded with sugar. Here, as with the Lara Bars, the sweetness comes from pureed dates and agave, a \"natural\" sweetener. The Wild Blueberry has a fresh taste that sets it apart from other raw bars. It also has a nice, chewy texture. We did a taste test and four out of five gave the bar a thumbs up. The one who didn\\'t like the bar also dislikes the Lara Bars and finds the taste a little off and too heavy for her. I personally thought the bar tasted OK, but not great -- there is something about that pureed date/agave taste that is unappealing after the first few bites.', u'These bars go into the \"buy when on sale\" category.  I LOVE the fact that the ingredients are simple, I know what they all are, and they\\'re organic.  Awesome!  Some bars appear to be natural from the packaging, but when you read the label there are all sorts of mystery ingredients.  No surprises here!In terms of flavor, I thought the flavor was good but not exceptionally so.  I enjoyed it, but I didn\\'t find myself craving for more or jonsing for another one an hour later.  Tasty, but memorable. i did like that it was moist and not hard or granola-y.  It didn\\'t taste like other \"health\" bars.So, overall, I liked them enough to buy them if I saw they were on sale, but I wouldn\\'t seek them out.', u'This is a pretty good bar.  It has a real nice fruitiness to it.  The cherry flavor is sweet-tart but not overly tart like a kids candy.  For me, the cashews is what really wins me over.  A 1.7 oz. bar provides 190 calories (8g fat, 25g carbs, 7g protein).  Not bad.  Compare to Odwalla bars that come in at 2 oz. and 200+ calories.  Personally, I would like the bar to be a little bigger but, I often eat these bars either as a meal or while I am walking a round of golf so I want as many calories as I can get.  The package is almost twice as long as the bar (marketing trick).Considering this bar is free of preservatives, trans fats, cholesterol, refined sugar, gluten, soy, and dairy it is pretty good.  If you have an allergy to any of those things this is a good snack food choice.', u\"I had this today with my afternoon coffee as a snack. The ingredients are good in that they fit in with our clean eating lifestyle. From a nutritional standpoint I would recommend these to anyone. Good snack for kids and teens. That said, they taste just like another product on the market called Larabars. Taste exactly the same in fact. In a blind taste test I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. So if you are thinking this is going to be something way cool and different, don't get too excited yet.\", u'My kids usually love anything that has the words \"bar\" and \"fruit\" in it.  But after a couple nibbles of this, they put them on the counter and said, \"I don\\'t want this.\"  I tasted it and didn\\'t blame them.  It\\'s bland, and just plain lacking.  I didn\\'t eat it either--it went into the trash.  We tried both cherry and blueberry flavors--same reaction to both.  I\\'d recommend Larabars instead of this if you\\'re looking for raw food or bars with no added sugar.', u'Maybe if I was stuck on a desert island and only had these to eat...then I would eat it again. I did not like the taste or the consistency.', u\"This bar has a good flavor which seems too fresh to be a wrapped product. Unfortunately it is heavy and dense, and sits in your stomach like lead after you've eaten it. It's certainly healthy -- organic; sweetened with agave; no preservatives, trans fats or cholesterol; full of heart-healthy Omega-3 fats. I just prefer a lighter snack.\", u\"This PURE bar contains nuts, fruit and berries, and also a little flavoring/sweetening.  It is vegan and kosher, and only 190 calories, so would make a good quick snack.  When purchased in bulk from Amazon it costs about $1.65, and while there's nothing wrong with this bar, I would suggest that combining nuts with dried fruit and berries to make trail mix would be more economical and also environmentally correct, as the PURE bar comes in a wrapper which has to be disposed of.\", u\"I liked this thing!  I'm not into bar-food.  I mean, I kind of like it but I don't regularly buy them or anything.  This one isn't much to look at: this dark brown mass that looks like it came right out from some industrial extruder BUT- it tastes just fine.  That first bite is like WOW TART but soon you get the surprising sweetness from the cherry juice throughout the bar.  It's really nice.  And I don't even like cherries!!!  Well, not much.  But they are awesome here - and a lotta nuts!  I love the nuts!  The bar is a bit on the dry side but the taste is really solid.  Better than most bar-type things out there you'll find.\", u'I\\'ve taken a picture of the product so you can see what it looks like.  I feel that the picture explains the texture and flavor better than I can.  As you can see in the picture, it has a consistency closer to a \"fruit rollup\" than a granola bar.After reading the ingredient list, its easy to see why the cherry flavor isn\\'t overwhelming- dates are the main ingredient.  I guess a date/cashew bar wouldn\\'t have sold so well but thats really what this is.It has 190 calories, enough to qualify as a decent snack.  Its sweet, thanks to the cherries, without any added sugar.  The ingredients list is:Dates, organic cashews, organic cherries, organic rice protein concentrate, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds.The rice protein additive bulks the protein up to 7 grams per bar, which is pretty impressive.overall, I take issue with calling it a Cherry Cashew bar... but... its very tasty and moister than many bars I\\'ve had.Definitely better than your average Clif bar or Granola bar.  In comparison, a clif bar is 11g of protein and 68g as opposed to 7g of protein and 48g.  And this bar tastes a LOT better.', u'I have tried A LOT of bars and I\\'ve had some truly great ones and some truly awful ones.  The PURE Organic Cherry Cashew falls close the great side of the spectrum.  The taste is actually better than I expected.  Many times the \"natural\" or \"organic\" bars tend to be dry or are barely stuck together raw materials.  These were moist and in a bar form that doesn\\'t crumble upon biting.  My problem with this bar is its bang for the buck.  I mean caloric bang for the nutrient buck and well as the 1.7oz size for the money.  200 calories for only 6g Protein and 4g Fiber seems like a lot to me.  For a few more calories (240) you can have a 2.4 oz Clif bar with 12g Protein and 5g Fiber.  Of course, bars - whether they are for energy, snacks, meal replacement or workouts are only good if you like the taste.  If you\\'re not after Protein and 200 calories is what you\\'re after - these are good!', u\"I'm more and more afraid of the chemicals and other ingredients which appear in our food supply, and afraid of the bland names chemicals are hidden behind.  On the other hand, I don't always have time to make every item we eat.  So I'm very pleased to find a product as delicious and good for you as the Pure bars.  They are a bit pricy as you are paying for real fruit, real nuts...as opposed to the fakery in the cheaply delivered processed food industry.  I enjoyed all the flavors excepting banana coconut, which was too strong for me.  Highly recommend as a healthy on the go snack.\", u'I split this snack bar between myself and my 2 kids. I got one bite because the kids both wanted \"more more!\"This was very exciting to see as we have tried several bars that are gluten free and dairy free that have tasted less than stellar. This is made from all organic raw ingredients: dates, cashews, rice protein concentrate, wild blueberries (with apple juice concentrate and sunflower oil), agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, blueberry flavor.According to the package it is certified organic and certified gluten free. It also says it is raw, vegan, and free of soy and dairy. The nutritional breakdown is 190 calories, 8 g fat (0.5 saturated), 0 cholesterol, 0 sodium, 180 mg potassium, 26 g carb with 3 g fiber, and 6 g protein. One concern that was raised for me was that the package also stated \"This product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, fish, and tree nuts.\" It does raise a potential for possible cross contamination.This is hands down the best snack bar I have ever tasted gluten free or otherwise. I will definitely be ordering some for my daughter to take to school for her snack.', u\"I'm always looking for things for the lunch box instead of candy bars. My husband works in construction and he's limited to what he can take for lunch without it going bad on hot days. Plus, he needs things he doesn't have to touch with his hands because he's usually got a lot of dirt on the job site and no access to a kitchen. These bars are a good choice for him because they are lower in calories than a candy bar but have a good amount of nutrition and fiber.The bar is made from dates, cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, blueberries with apple juice concentrate and sunflower oil, agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. It isn't cooked. The bar is 190 calories and contains 3 grams of fiber, 8 grams of fat, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 6 grams of protein. It also has a fair amount of potassium (180 mg), which is supposed to help balance sodium and help to keep blood pressure under control.The texture is dense but not heavy or gritty. It seems a bit less heavy than some other bars I've bought, and it has a good blueberry scent and flavor. The sweetness is about right and doesn't make my mouth feel like I need to brush my teeth.\", u'These bars come in at 4 Weight Watchers points, which is about twice what I normally allocate for snacks, but the extra points are completely worth it.  The bar is just sweet enough, just crunchy enough, just fruity enough to taste good without being overpowering.  I will definitely pick some more of these up, and am looking forward to trying the other flavors.', u\"I really like cashews and this bar has large pieces of them in it, which made me really happy. The bar is a good size for an afternoon snack or a pick me up while exercising/hiking at 1.7 oz. The ingredients are very natural with organic dates, cashews, cherries, walnuts, almonds, agave nectar and rice protein being the entirety of them. The cherries are a bit tart which helps give the bar a good flavor with enough sweetness added by the agave nectar. The bar is rather soft, but firm enough to hold. It is a tad sticky but won't leave a residue on your fingers. I really liked this bad.\", u'I LOVE this flavor. It is everything I could want and more out of raw fruit bar. The cherry taste is amazing and I would eat a whole box of these in one sitting if I could. I have had other brands of raw cherry bars but this is by far the best. I could not recommend this more if you are looking for a raw fruit and/or raw cherry bar.', u\"It is difficult to judge food from one experience. I was sent one bar and tried it. I would not buy another one based on this single experience.The bar claims to be one serving of fruit. I believe that claim. I could taste the cherries and dates. I'd rather eat real fruit to get my serving. It tastes better. The bar is also gluten-free and kosher. A great snack alternative, but again it does not beat the real thing. It has 8 grams of fat, no transfat or cholesterol, low in sodium and high in calories-190. Again, have a piece of fruit. There is only one instance where this bar may be preferred to fruit, and that is if one is traveling for a period of time and cannot keep fruit for a number of days outside refrigeration.\", u'This bar contains only good (not processed) ingredients with dates and cashews first and second in the ingredients list. However, I thought the bar was tasteless and slightly sweet.  At 190 calories a bar (70 fat calories), it is not something I would purchase because I felt unsatisified after eating it.', u'We love the sweetness and chewy-ness of this bar. I also appreciate the back-story on how this company came into being. Makes me appreciate the bar even more. We enjoy this one and other flavors as well.', u\"So hard to believe that these are good for you. Wish I had bought more. Chewy, tasty, and good enough to make you feel like you aren't missing anything by giving up gluten.\", u\"I am always on the lookout for a healthy snack to carry in my purse in case I can't stop when my tummy rumbles to get a meal. I've always shied away from those super-health food bars, because in past experience, you take too much sugar, salt, etc out of something, you end up not being able to tell the taste of the food from the wrapper it came in. I was surprised this time! This is actually GOOD. In addition to being good for you. So I can be happy, and my doctor can be happy. It's chewy, moist, sweet enough and tastes fresh. No weird aftertaste. I will definitely be carrying these in my purse.\", u'This is a soft-chewy bar (kind of like a date is soft chewy--like a date paste but in a bar), about 3 inches long x 1  wide (inside the wrapper) and less than  inch thick, not a granola bar, a cherry type taste with plenty of cashew bits throughout, nice smooth taste, seems filling.  It kind of reminds you of a date taste, enhanced with cherry taste.  Certified Organic by USDA seal.  Certified gluten free.Ingredients, in order listed are:  organic dates, organic cashews, organic cherries, organic rice protein concentrate, organic walnuts, organic agave nectar (sweetener), organic almonds.  Nothing cooked.  Nothing processed.  Is processed in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, nuts and fish.  Comes from Holland, Michigan.Nutrition: 1 bar has 190 calories, 70 of which are fat calories. Has 0 trans fat, 5 mg sodium, 220 mg potassium, 17 g sugars (in natural fruit sugars).  Also has Vitamins C and B6, Calcium, Iron, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Folate, Phosphorus, magnesium, Zinc, and Copper.  It comes in a sealed foil wrapper.I like it and I would definitely have it again.  It tastes pretty good, sounds non-abrasive, and seems healthy.  It has a nice serving of potassium too.  (Note--I am not a doctor, but as you lose fluid, you are supposed to ensure you maintain sufficient potassium levels.  As the humid sweaty days approach the east coast, this might be a good product to re-supply the potassium you, or your children, lose in the summer.)', u'They were a little smaller than I expected, esp for the calories.  But I love the ingredients (or lack there of), and it does a good job filling you up for the little bit you have :)', u\"The texture is grainy for my tastes.  My favorite flavors are the blueberry and the dark chocolate berry bar.  I will use them for quick pick-me-ups after workouts and if I'm running behind at work and can't get a healthy meal.  It's better than fast food!\", u'I split the bar in half and shared it with my son. We both liked the cherry taste and we yearned to have more bars on hand for snacks. With a glass of milk, this would be a satisfying and healthy snack food. Compared to chips and candy bars, this did not have an overly sweet taste and was more filling than an entire candy bar, with no peaks in blood sugar levels.', u\"The flavor and texture of this bar isn't quite what i was expecting, but it has a delightful balance of sweet, tart, and nutty that is very pleasing. I love that it is made by Pure, which is a company i have trusted for years, and i love that it has no added sugar, and is organic. It's also vegan & gluten-free.The only thing that would make this bar better is if it had more protein and fiber - 7grams of protein and 3g of fiber is certainly better than a candy bar, but i wish it packed a little more punch. But overall it's a great bar that i would definitely eat again!\", u\"I liked the fact that this bar was all organic, but hey does that mean that because it's organic, it gets a pass on taste? I don't think so. It was just okay. You can find better tasty and organic alternatives in my opinion that are not as pricey. I was not sure what to make of the texture which like one reviewer said, is not crunchy and is something like a fig newton bar. The bar itself is pretty small and for the calories, I think you can eat something else that would probably be less calories and more filling. I just was not impressed at all by this bar. Not sure if I would purchase if given the chance.\", u'Per my husbands quote, \"It tastes like all those other health bars.\"We split the bar since it was not safe for my kids to eat.Per the label allergens listed were:Contains:  cashews, walnuts, almonds.Produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, tree nuts.I don\\'t know how it can claim gluten free if processed with wheat?  Or Dairy?  Or soy?  The label makes all these claims.  Anyone on an allergen free diet would never touch this bar.  It would be nice if the description listed all this for the buyer to be aware of.  Newly allergic folks would probably just be stuck with goods they may not be able to eat.If it was not for the allergen issues, I would consider eating it.  It does not have a cherry flavor at first bite, but the after taste does have cherry.  Pleasantly chewy.I would but the Organic Food Bars before these for sure.  Safer allergen profile and still all natural with no fake stuff.', u'Great flavor.  Ingredient list seems healthful and organic.  High sugar content though -- its naturals from fruits but still not as nutritionally balanced as a Kashi bar for instance.', u'I had high hopes for the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar and am sad to say I was disappointed. The description sounded appealing and the flavor sounded like a good one which is why I decided to try it. I loved the fact it was organic, all natural, high in fiber and omega-3s. Unfortunately, I was completely unimpressed.The texture was the first thing I noticed about the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar that I did not like. It was grainy and a bit chalky, completely unappealing to me. I also did not like the fact they use apple juice as a sweetener for the bar, touting the fact this is all natural and not refined  sugar. However, apple juice is one of the highest sugar content fruit juices available on the market and is often used as a sweetener/filler in products because it is so cheap to produce, so this was not a positive selling point for me at all.Also, for this being sold as a blueberry bar, the blueberry flavor was not nearly as strong as I would expect from a \"blueberry bar.\" Personally, blueberries are one of my absolute favorite fruits and one I cannot get enough of when they are in season. So I had hoped this bar would have tasted better. The other ingredients, the nuts and the dates, overwhelmed the blueberries, not surprising when you look at the ingredient list and see that blueberries are not even one of the top 5 on the list.I can honestly say that I will not be adding the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar to my grocery list in the future and will continue seeking other alternatives instead. Kelley A. Hartsell, June 2010. All rights reserved.', u\"Fruit and nut concoction that is both delicious and nutritious with large pieces of nuts and an overall cherry flavor throughout a bar that is nicely tangy. I also think the decent protein and fiber content (7 and 3 or 4 respectively) made it a nice stick-to-your-ribs snack. I have tried the Pure Wild Blueberry Fruit and Nut bar, too, and I think I like the Cherry better due to the cherry flavor throughout the bar. The texture is very much Larabarish if you've had those before. (If not think thick fruit leather with nut chunks.) If you have allergies it does have a standard allergy warning covering lots of allergy issues including peanuts.\", u'PURE organic wild blueberry raw fruit and nut bar looks a lot like a Larabar but doesn\\'t quite surpass it in taste.  If you\\'re living by Michael Pollan\\'s dictum (\"the fewer ingredients, the better\"), it plays second fiddle to Larabar as well.This 1.7 oz. snack bar contains nine ingredients.  Although dates place first in the ingredient parade, it is the taste of nuts that is most prevalent in this snack.  Thus, ingredients #2, #3, and #7 (organic cashews, organic walnuts, and organic almonds respectively).  Oddly, organic wild blueberries are the fourth ingredient and are suffused parenthetically with the rather ubiquitous organic apple juice concentrate as well as organic sunflower oil.  Odder still, the natural blueberry is supplemented with ingredient #9, organic blueberry \"flavor.\"  I say odd because this snack does not deliver a powerful blueberry taste, which I like.  Rather, the flavor of blueberry is more of an aftertaste than a hit-your-palate-as-you-chew taste.The product is small but delivers 190 calories, 70 of them from fat (as you might expect from a snack with healthy nuts).  On the plus side, you can\\'t argue with PURE\\'s organic pedigree.  All there, all labeled USDA organic.  Thus, the \"health\" rating is high, though I figured most curious shoppers would take that for granted based on the description.  This rating, then, is based more on taste.  Bottom line?  Not bad.  But not good enough to unseat the established Larabar from its perch, either.', u'These bars a delicious, and I feel good knowing that they are better for me than other snacks. I am not a vegan, but I enjoy wholesome organic snacks like these.', u\"This bar has a good flavor, and a good texture. It's too bad that it looks like poop though. But don't let that discourage you, because it really is good.\", u\"Ok, these things are pretty tasty.  The blueberry flavor is rich, but subtle.  The ingredients are all organic.  But let's face it, when you're energy bar shopping, you want to know how they compare to Clif bars, right?  The Pure bar is 1.7oz, contains 8 grams of fat, 3 grams of fiber, and 6 grams of protein.  The Clif bar is 2.4oz (50% larger than the Pure bar), contains 5 grams of fat, 7 grams of fiber, and 10 grams of protein.  Most, but not all, of the ingredients of the Clif bar are organic and they've added vitamins to fortify their bar.  The Pure bars are about $1.57 each, while the Clif bars are about a buck.  All in all, the Clif bars seem to be a better bargain, unless you feel strongly about having every ingredient be organic.\", u\"This mixed nut and fruit bar has a flavor reminiscent of blueberry-flavored instant oatmeal, and a not-unpleasant chewy texture.  It isn't too sweet, as many such snack foods are.  One was filling enough that I didn't find myself reflexively reaching for a second.But without wheat gluten, it's pressed together and bound with oil so it looks vaguely industrial from the package.  It's so greasy that I felt the need to wash my hands after eating.  And bits of nut got stuck in my teeth and hurt so badly that I had to brush right away.If I were on a gluten-free diet, I'd enjoy this snack.  But for someone with no restrictions, it's just okay.  I support organic, unprocessed, and healthy, but if I don't enjoy the taste, it doesn't exactly beckon me back.\", u\"A great way to curb hunger. Portable and tasty. The only change I would make is I would add more protein to the mix, otherwise it's a nice little product.\", u'I do not care for dried fruit but this bar was rather surprisingly tasty. I really enjoyed this as a mid day snack. It also was good in the evening when I felt a bit hungry but did not want to eat something heavy. These would be excellent for travel too. The bar is not too sweet but full of flavor and crunchiness. Try it - you will like it.', u'The Pure Bar is by far the most delicious health bar I ever had.  Unlike all other similar bars I\\'ve tried, this one does not taste the least bit processed.  The ingredients used are all-natural and organic, and the texture and taste of the bar reflect that.  The ingredients are not \"glued\" together the way they are in many other bars, yet the bar sticks together well and does not fall apart at all.I really loved how all the fruits and nuts in the bar taste fresh.  When biting into the bar you can taste each ingredient\\'s unique flavor, yet the tastes all go together so well.  Due to the dates and cherries in the bar, it has a slightly \"tangy\" flavor, which leaves a wonderful aftertaste.  The bar is only minimally-sweetened, so it\\'s not the usual sugar overload that you might expect.If you enjoy tart tasting bars, and truly appreciate the flavors of the various ingredients that go into this bar, I cannot recommend this Pure Bar highly enough.', u'I came home and just wanted to grab something small before doing some exercise.  Those bars just had arrived and I figured I might as well.  Boy, they are something else.  Very moist and solid with a not overly sweet taste.  Exceedingly delicious.  Best of all, its all natural.  The only downside I found is that the quality and richness of flavor comes with an almost 200 calorie price tag.  But compared to other bars, this is clearly the winner.', u\"The nuts are what make this bar tolerable. The texture without them is unpleasant. I guess that's because there is no egg, flour or corn syrup used to hold it together. It reminds me of an Atkin's bar I tried once. Water to wash it down is a MUST!Certified Organic Ingredients include: Organic Dates, Organic Cashews, Organic Walnuts, Organic Rice Protein Concentrate, Organic Wild Blueberries (With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Sunflower Oil), Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds, Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate, Organic Blueberry Flavor.3 STARS: I gave the taste a 1 and added 2 stars for the healthy factor. These sound so good for you that I wish I liked them.\", u'Uhg!  I ate this for breakfast with an apple & my stomach is already growling and it\\'s only been like an hour.  I guess this would make a good snack bar, but the calories are kinda high for a snack (190).Compared to the blueberry Pure bar, this has more flavor.  Unfortunately neither bar is filling.  The cherry bar has a nice tart cherry taste.  Those of you looking for something sickly sweet, you will not find it here despite the Agave \"nectar\" (high fructose sugar stuff) that is in it.  If it wasn\\'t for the high fructose agave syrup (they like to make it sound oh so healthy by calling it agave nectar), I would rate this bar a star higher.  I am on a mission to find agave free organic Vegan bars aside from Lara bars & haven\\'t had any sucess.  It is so disappointing that the health food industry has jumped on the cheap sweet Agave rather than something else, like organic maple syrup or untreated organic sugar?  Organic maple syrup is delish, but oops expensive, so I guess I wont be seeing it in any Vegan bars anytime soon.Now if you think I\\'m a loon because of the Agave thing, go ahead & research it.  That\\'s all I have to say.Anyway, if you are not concerned about agave or not looking for something to keep you from being hungry then this is a pretty tasty tart treat.  Maybe this would be better suited as a dessert bar.  Yes, I think so.  This would make a great dessert bar for me if they got rid of the agave!', u'The cherry cashew bar was pretty much exactly what you would expect of an all natural nothing extra snack bar.  Small and not terribly attractive to look at it tastes ok.  I actually thought it was a little salty and chewy.', u'However, it is a little dry.  I like the blueberry pieces in this bar, they added needed moisture to the nut meats that tend to dry out a bar.  Overall, a pleasant and Organic treat for those times when \"the nibbles\" overcomes self control.', u'The flavor of this cherry cashew fruit and nut bar is really tasty!  The texture is pleasant and I appreciate that unlike many snack bars, it has a more chewy consistency.  However, because it\\'s chewy, it\\'s also quite oily.  I\\'m sure this adds to the flavor, but this doesn\\'t \"feel\" like a healthy snack.  Makes a great mid-morning or afternoon treat, though.  I\\'d definitely eat another one or two!', u'This date-cashew-cherry bar has a great balance of tastes, it\\'s not too sweet or too tart, even manages to balance chewy and crunchy textures.  As a non-vegan and someone who does not intentionally eat raw food products, I was really impressed.  Most of the gluten-free snacks I\\'ve tried have been painfully obvious in their omissions, but these are really good!  My first impression of the Pure Bar was that it was smaller than I expected, certainly more of a snack than a meal, but it could easily hold me over for a few hours on a flight or at work.I was surprised at how high in fat these are, though I understand it is \"good fat\" and that a vegan/raw foods diet is leaner in general.  But, as an omnivore, I\\'d recommend making sure that they fit into your overall diet well before making them a staple.', u\"While organic raw food cereal snd nut bars are nothing new, this one left me pleasantly surprised. You're probably best served, health-wise, by eating whole blueberries, but this is a good subsitute, and provides 12 percent of your daily value of fiber as well. B-vitamins and antioxidants are in every bite. It has 19g of sugars--about the same as a Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bar with Almonds. So, even if you're a chocoholic, like me, in most cases this bar is a better alternative as a snack.\", u\"If you want a snack/meal bar made with organic, nutrionally-rich ingredients, this is a great one, with these healthy ingredients:Organic blueberries--antioxidants & fiber & vitamins A,C,E & betacarotene & minerals.Organic dates--vitamins A,C,B & natural sugars & fiber.  An energy-boosting food.Organic cashews--heart-healthy fats, fiber, B vitamins, & minerals.Organic almonds--heart-healthy fats, vitamins B & E, manganese & other minerals, fiber, most calcium of any other tree nut.I read once that you can't go wrong with kosher food, as the quality of ingredients and production is going to be top-notch, so I like that about these bars.This is not one of those bars that are super-sweet with refined sugars, so don't expect that kind of taste. They actually just simply taste like the ingredients that they're made with, giving you a nutty, fruity-sweet snack.  The dates seem to give it most of the sweetness and flavor.  If you're not used to the more healthy, natural bars, these may take some getting used to for you, both in flavor/sweetness and consistency.I suppose that you could make these at home, having so few & easily-obtainable ingredients, but it's just super convenient to buy these ready-made bars.  These would be great to keep with you for a very filling and lasting snack/small meal out on the road or on the trail.\", u'Nothing exceptional about this bar; much like most others out there already. Has the consistency / texture of a \"zone\" or \"balance\" bar.  Not to thick and heavy, on the light side.', u\"I was surprised by how moist and chewy the PURE bar was, and the taste was surprisingly good as well. I really liked the fact that this bar was both organic and raw, without the typically unhealthy ingredients you find in similar products.My only complaint is that they don't indicate on the packaging or amazon page whether or not the raw nuts have been soaked, which aids the digestability of the nuts.\", u'I have a hard time eating breakfast.  The experts say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but I still was never a big fan of the morning meal...until I discovered Pure Bar.  I eat either this bar or another brand with nuts, seeds and fruits with a glass of orange/carrot juice.  I highly recommend Pure Bar Blueberry and Cherry.  Yum!', u\"I am a blueberry fan. I put them in lots of baked goods, eat them fresh every summer. So I was excited to try this bar in blueberry; I've been eating the PURE Cherry bars for some time now. I was surprised by the taste of these bars, neither pleasantly nor unpleasantly, just surprised. They were not very sweet - and the cherry bars are. So this was both good and bad. The cherry bars sometimes are too sweet and I feel like I've eaten candy afterward, whereas the blueberry bars have a subtle sweetness with a mellow flavor. The cashews dominate the taste in these. So, for every day fare, (especially for gluten free people) theses are much more grounding and more food-like than candy like. However, it's not necessarily a taste that I would crave every day. But that's me. They are definitely worth adding to your collection of bars - it's always nice to have variety. Enjoy!\", u\"4.5 starsI eat raw off and on when I need to get my health back in gear, and as a long-term vegetarian and hiker I've tried just about every food bar out there over the last 20+ years. By their standards I'd have to call this blueberry bar one of the best I've ever tasted, and for the price vs. the quality of ingredients this one's a winner. I like its taste even more than Pure's very good cherry cashew bar.It's very moist and chewy, not dry and sawdusty like so many bars, and if you didn't know it was all raw you'd think it was merely a tasty fruit bar. But unlike most food bars this one is full of enzymes that will help you digest the nutrition herein, instead of dead, denatured ingredients that will just become a brick in your gut. I ate this bar while hiking in the woods and soon felt a real surge of energy, a nice smooth blood sugar plateau that lasted for well over an hour and left no crash or bad feelings thereafter.So: it tastes good, is very good for you, and by supporting organic agriculture you're helping America's small farmers. Not one thing to not like here, and I'll be eating plenty more of these as life goes by!\", u\"I love these bars. The Pure Organic Wild Blueberry bar has only a slight blueberry flavor. However, it has a pleasant taste and is filling. I especially liked the nutty flavor and texture.I especially like the ingredients: Organic Dates, Organic Cashews, Organic Rice Protein Concentrate, Organic Wild Blueberries, etc. You get the idea.This raw fruit and nut bar is good and good for you. I'll gladly reach for this rather than a candy bar.\", u\"Okay, this blueberry bar was more like a date bar. Here is the ingredient list:Organic Dates, Organic Wild Blueberries (With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Canola Oil), Organic Cashews, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Lemon Juice Concentrate.I appreciate that the bar is gluten free and organic. But I really would have liked more blueberry flavor. The texture was okay. The bar was more on the hard side, not really soft or chewy. At 190 calories and 6 grams of protein with a whole lot of carbs (26 grams), I would only use this as an occasional snack/meal replacement type thing. Instead of this bar, I'd rather have a small organic salad with protein toppings. For what it is, it is okay. I'd give my kids this over a candy bar any day.\", u'I love PURE bars.  The Dark Chocolate Berry Bar is a tasty and refreshing addition to the PURE family.  My favorite of all is Cherry Cashew, but this Dark Chocolate Berry is a very close second.', u\"Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Raw Fruit and Nut BarCertified Organic by Quality Assurance InternationalCertified Organic Ingredients:Organic DatesOrganic CashewsOrganic WalnutsOrganic Rice Protein ConcentrateOrganic Wild Blueberries (with organic Apple Juice Concentrate and organic Sunflower Oil)Organic Agave NectarOrganic AlmondsOrganic Lemon Juice ConcentrateOrganic Blueberry FlavorNothing Else!It's vegan, it's raw, it's organic, it's delicious. Has a good blueberry, nutty taste.  Not like any fruit bar I have eaten before. I really liked this one. I ate in while on a business trip on the air plane.  It held me over until lunch about three hours later.I am getting more of them, they are that good.\", u\"Given the attributes: raw, vegan, and gluten-free, it would be reasonable to expect this bar to be unpalatable, especially considering some of the disgusting food bars I've come across that *didn't* offer anything special.  However PURE has done a fine job with the texture and flavor.  It's gooey and mildly sweet, with crunchy nuts.The blueberries came across more as aroma than actual taste, which was a little disappointing.It's not going to replace Clif Bars for my hiking excursions, but if I have a vegan or Celiac friend coming along, I'll recommend these.\", u\"...but after that, I found eating a PureBar to be something of a task.Pros:Filling--the bar was very dense and, coupled with some water, really sated my hunger.Tasted like real blueberry. There wasn't any artificial aftertaste or flavor to the bar, which was great: it tasted fresh. It even smelled awesome.Portability. Because of the small size of the bar, it can be easily thrown in a bag, glovebox, or backpack to bring with you.Cons:The biggest drawback--and really the only huge drawback-- was the unusual mouth-feel/texture: it was a little too thick/dense for me, and as a result felt undercooked. The texture also didn't lend itself to the size of the bar; my jaw got tired trying to chew it.Nuts. I don't like nuts in most things, and found the walnuts (?) included in the bar to overwhelm the taste. If there weren't nuts, this probably would have gotten a four star rating.Bottom line:The blueberry Pure Bar that I ate was generally disappointing. The taste was fine, but the inclusion of nuts added too much of a bitter flavor. Coupled with the texture of the product, it wasn't an overwhelmingly enjoyable experience to eat (and really, who likes to eat things they don't enjoy?). In the future, I could imagine purchasing these for day-hikes or camping trips, or to throw along a long running or cycling route. But it's not a product I would include in my day-to-day diet.\", u\"I am a Cranberry/Orange fanatic anyway.  My wife bought me these and I just couldn't belive the taste!  The flavors of cranberry and orange come through clear and unmistakable.  If I wasn't watching my weight I could go through a box a day.\", u\"Okay, these are good for people who are on gluten-free, kosher, vegan, or soy-free diets, and they do have vitamins, but the taste is very bland.  The bar is all natural--organic and raw. Were those blueberries I tasted or cardboard?  I'd rather go hungry than eat this.\", u\"It's very healthy snack with quality ingredients without artificial garbage, that tastes alright. There are somethings that are good to know though:1) Its consistency is less like a snack bar and more like dense cake.2) It's not as sweet as something like Nutrigrain. It's more subtle.\", u'I tried two flavors and this Blueberry bar is second (compared to the Cherry Cashew).  I usually love dried blueberries but perhaps this needed a little more sweetness to bring out the flavor.  The texture is halfway between soft and chewy, which is OK.  With a fairly good balance of fiber, natural carbohydrates, protein, and low sodium it makes a good afternoon snack.', u\"So I tested this bar on my family...they thought it was good but not great.  They said they would eat it of course but it's not the fav.It was really soft and hearty, full  of chopped nuts, some berries, and all in a pureed type thickened base.  It seemed almost like a thick fruit leather with lots of nuts for protein.  How can that be bad?  It's organic, full of healthy/raw elements and easy to use for a quick snack or meal on the go.Positives: Organic, No Gluten, full serving of fruit, omega 3's, fiber, protein, Raw & Vegan!\", u\"This bar is labeled Certified GF, Certified organic  and Vegan. It is an awesome little packet of nutrition : it has a full serving of fruit, rich in Omega-3's, is a good source of fiber, has raw unprocessed ingredients and is vegan.Where flavor is concerned, it was a little tart for my 8 year old (who has celiac) but I liked the cashew-cherry combination . There are chunks of cashew in the bar so it has a nice texture too.However, where the allergy information is concerned the package states that 'this product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, fish and tree nuts'.I know that there are different degrees to which people with celiac disease (and other gluten related issues) avoid Gluten. I started out avoiding anything that was made in a facility that processed gluten. Under that criteria I would not have bought these bars.I now avoid items if they are made on machinery that is also used to process items that contain gluten so the bars are ok by my current standards but I did think that it should be mentioned since the facility is not a dedicated gluten free facility and some of us do tend to need/want that.\", u\"Although these bars are a bit pricey they are a great snack. You can actually taste a bit of the cherries' tartness. I probably would have liked it a bit more tart, but that's just me. Made with cashews, walnuts and almonds it's not just tasty but may even be good for you.\", u\"First things first: I really love this snack bar. I tried the Cherry Cashew one and I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Before tasting it I read the packaging and really liked the fact that this bar is a raw and unprocessed snack without any artificial flavoring or ingredients. It also provides you with 7g of protein and 3g of fiber per serving. However, when something is that good for you it usually doesn't taste that great. But the Pure Bar is different. The texture is chewy with lots of different nut pieces in it and it has a sweet taste to it that is just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely be ordering more of these and keep them around for a healthy snack option. LOVE IT!\", u\"I have been a very healthy organic foods eater for over 12 years.  My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track. Some other theses I really like, others aren't so tasty for me.  (Amazon.com does not sell these at the time of this review.)If you found my review helpful, please click the YES button below.  Thank you and good eating!\", u'I have never been a fan of health bars at all.  They are usually grainy tasting, too sweet, bitter aftertaste, or contain some kind of artificial \"natural\" sweetner.  Or all of the above.I was expecting the same with these.  Boy was I pleasently surprised.These bars have an excellent consistancy. They have a wonderful fruity taste that is neither cloying nor bitter.  The bars with nuts are fabulous because it adds an extra flavor and slight crunch without shattering your jaw with every bite.I can personally recommend the blueberry, the cherry cashew, the apple cinnamon, and the brownie because after my Vine evaluation I immediately bought one case of each from Amazon (excellently priced I might add) and will be replenishing my cupboard.Please give these bars a try.  They are really really great.  Honestly.', u'As these bars are made without most of the bad stuff in others, they taste rather different. Not bad, just different. Noticeably less sweet, and without the artificial binders, they also feel different in terms of texture. It would take some getting used to, doing without all that sugary flavor, but the blueberry bar tasted just fine.', u'This is a pretty healthy little bar. No added sugar (unlike most \"health\" bars) and rather satisfying.The bar has a good chewy texture and isn\\'t a bad amount.The sweetness in this bar is due to the dates and all the ingredients are real food, nothing is listed which I need to hit Google to figure out what it is.Over all I\\'m pretty happy with the sample I received from Amazon vine.', u\"I liked this snack bar.  It's not very sweet but tastes very fruity.  It is soft and chewy. The wrapping was easy to open and did a good job at keeping the fruit bar fresh. I wish the fruit bar was bigger. I tried both the blueberry and the Cherry flavor and liked them both about equally well.\", u\"with all sorts of things that I'm sure are good for you in moderation.  Is it PURE? Don't know about that but it did fill me up instead of eating a candy bar.  And, it lasted for around 3 hours.I will buy this again as it's perfect to keep in the car, book bag or purse.  No chocolate to melt into the side of the package.  Packed full of energy, calories and protein.\", u'Some important facts: 190 calories per bar, 70 of which are from fat (nuts and sunflower oil); raw ingredients; free of refined sugar, gluten, additives; provides a full serving of fruit; 6 g of protein; 3 g of fiber.I am a regular consumer of health bars. I like them for an easy and nutritious breakfast. I am pretty health-conscious, and I like organic products. I have tried many brands of bars: Lara, Kashi, Clif, Clif Z-bar, Odwalla, Kind, and several others.This Pure bar is my new favorite.Here are the things I like: the product has a pleasant fruitcake-y smell. It is moist, with large pieces of nut and somewhat smaller pieces of fruit throughout. It is sort of dense, but NOT heavy. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly so (*coughCLIFcough*). It is NOT gritty (*coughCLIFcough*). It just tastes good.I would like to see a more protein content (10 g range). That is my only real complaint.I will gladly buy more of these and less of the other products that satisfy me less.', u'PURE appears to be the exception to a trend in energy bars; rather than being empty calories, it is genuinely nutritioous.  My only complaint is minor; I think it could use a handful more of cashews for a chewier consistency.  Flavor is subtle, not the typical sugar rush of chocolate-covered bars.The PURE bar itself has a slightly sticky texture, but it should backpack well.  I am not troubled by the slightly bitter aftertaste, which disappears immediately after a sip of any beverage.I have not yet found this product at local outlets.  Amazon will be my main source for the moment.  I think PURE is a definite buy.', u\"The bar tasted fine enough in the eating, with the nuts adding a light crunch to an otherwise smooth bar. However, after finishing, there was an aftertaste of flour that lasted for a few minutes. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, but I certainly would have appreciated no aftertaste more.\", u\"The texture of this cherry cashew PURE bar is similar to the packaged brownies you can find in convenience stores.  It is very dense and quite moist. I am always looking for new gluten free snacks, so I was happy to come across this bar.  The taste, however, is not what I'd hoped for.  While it is not terrible, I don't see myself buying this flavor of PURE bar in the future. I like the crunchy nuts, but the overly sweet cherry flavor is too much for me.  The bar is sweetened with agave, and I think it might taste better with half the amount included.\", u\"The bar is quite small, although in it's defense it seems that all nutrition bars are getting progressively smaller. That's one way to get the calorie count down. Of course the high price remains the same.Flavor-wise it was below average for a nutrition bar. The cherry flavor bar is awful and I wouldn't recommend it at all. The blueberry was better, though both have a rather unpleasant undertaste of...I don't know what.I would buy it if there was no other choice available. However, my first choice remains the Zone Bar.\", u\"My 26 year old daugher has been a vegitarian for a year now.  I'm always trying to find her products that are nutritious and that she will actually eat.  Most of the protien bars available are dry and imposible to eat on the run without having a drink handy.  she absolutely loves these because the are not only yummy but also moist and don't leave her dry mouthed.  I have to keep fully stocked because I'm hooked on them too.\", u\"Some of these types of bars are so dense and chewy that I don't enjoy them, and often the stated flavor isn't very evident.  The sample Pure bar I received had a strong blueberry taste and a great texture.  The packaging states that it has no refined sugar. If you do any research online, you will find that whether sugar is refined or not it has the same effect on your body so that shouldn't influence whether you buy this bar.\", u\"This snack bar has several good things going for it.  If you like the chewy, not crunchy type of bars, you'll most likely love the texture of these.  They contain no preservatives, trans fats, or cholesterol.  They are also gluten, soy and dairy free.  The combination of dried raw dates and cherries,  along with walnuts, cashews and almonds provides a filling, not overly sweet treat.  You can purchase these organic bars at a price comparable to many brands sold at the supermarket.\", u\"This is very good. It's not crunchy like a granola bar, but has a somewhat chewy texture and does not stick to your teeth.  The dates are not overpowering & there's tiny bits of nuts & a little taste of cherry with each bite.  According to the Diabetes Food Pyramid this bar equals a full serving of fruit.I'm a label reader & noticed that the nutrition facts on the label differ from the nutrition facts on the web page. So, I'll list them from the label:Serving size: 1 bar, 48gCalories: 190; Fat Calories: 70Total Fat: 8g; Sat.

Chewy and not too sweet but a fairly strong cherry flavor.  By this time I was wishing I hadn't shared the bar.My friend then called wanting more.  She loved it as well saying she will definitely purchase these.So from two different sides of the spectrum, we give the Pure Bar 4 thumbs up!Give them a try!Thank you!MEF\", u'Overall this product appears to be healthy.  I just did not care for the taste or consistency of the bar.', u'I\\'m a big fan of Larabars, and especially like the Cherry Pie... these are pretty good, but I like the Larabar version better in that it\\'s got a snappier flavor.I find both bars are similar in being \"whole foods\" but also an overprocessed gooey mess, and a little too sweet for my tastes.Ingredients, from the wrapper: Organic dates, organic cashews, organic cherries, organic rice protein concentrate, organic walnuts, organic agave nectar, organic almonds.190 calories, and the bar is 1.7oz, just like Larabars.I prefer the Cherry Pie Larabars, but this is pretty good.', u\"After tryingPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12), and loving it, I had high hopes for this organic cherry bar.  After trying the fresh flavor of the blueberry bar, I expected this to taste of fresh cherries and nuts.  Unfortunately, the cherries definitely didn't taste fresh, and I couldn't finish the bar.  Even get my husband (who absolutely loves everything cherry) didn't like the cherry bar..  I'm glad I tried the blueberry bar first; I might not have given it a chance if I had tried the cherry bar first.I'll give it three stars for being a healthy food.  If you're really into dried fruit, you might like this.  If you hope for a fresh flavor, you'll probably be disappointed (as I was).\", u'This is just a taste review:I barely find bars which does not taste astronauts food. This one does not. It reminds me of date pastes, the sweetness is moderate, the texture is not too soft, not too hard, and does not leave a bad after taste.I just had half of a bar for the first time and the freshness and novelty flavor made me write this review.', u'I have previously triedPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and liked that bar to the same degree as this bar. Pure claims their bar is \"Organic; Raw; Gluten-Free; Certified Kosher; Certified Vegan; Healthy; Delightful\". Each bar is 190 calories and contains 8 grams of total fat, 7 grams of proteins and 25 grams of total carbohydrates. The Cherry Cashew bar does contain 5 mg of sodium. When I open the bar there was no aroma of cherry and the bar look like all the date bars now being sold as this type of organic bar. Though this date paste has a smooth texture holding in place chopped nuts and dried cherries. You do get a strong cherry burst of flavor when you bite into a part of the bar containing the dried cherries. Best of all, besides being edible, is that it leaves no lingering aftertaste. I would buy these if I was hungry and needed something on the go. This is not a bar that I would seek out but I would eat it.', u\"I missed lunch and had this bar with me so I tried it.  It tastes good, is filling and is an organic meal that includes fruit, protein and Omega-3s.  I've just started a raw foods diet and this bar qualifies as raw food.  I'll be buying more.\", u'Maybe I was raised on too many processed sugars and prepackaged food but it seems the more \"natural\" things get, the more they tend to taste like cardboard. Needless to say, I was not a big fan of this product.', u'I have to say I am very impressed with these Pure bars. Often times protein bars are gritty and just plain bad tasting. Surprisingly these bars are moist, full flavored and even slightly chunky from the nuts in them. I ate one for lunch to see how long it would tide me over. It managed to keep me comfortable until dinner time which is what I was hoping. I plan on keeping these handy for those days I am out and about with little time to stop and eat. I will definitely purchase again.', u'Pure Organic wild blueberry bar is delicious.  The ingredients are all natural, wholesome, and good.  Would purchase this bar again.  Taste like fruit bar made with real fruits without artifical flavors or preservatives.  Good substitute for certain food cravings and maybe some energy boost.  Has sweet flavors (of blueberry and walnut) and not sugary sweet.  This is like a bar you would make at home if you could.  Great for backpacks and lunch boxes.', u\"As I get a bit older & wiser, I am constantly looking for more healthful foods & supplements to enhance my overall well being. I've found yet another piece of the nutrition puzzle withPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12). These delicious bars have everything you'd want in a healthy snack, with none of the junk you should certainly want to avoid. They are made with raw oragnic ingredients, are low in fat, an excellent source of fiber and are just plain tasty. And there are kosher, to boot! Further, they have no refined sugars, no gluten, dairy or soy, no trans-fat, no preservatives and, as the label says, no artificial nothin'!The only concern anyone might have is if they had an allergy to nuts of some type, as these delightful, delicious bars are made with cashews, almonds & walnuts. Otherwise, munch your way to better health with this marvelous snack!You will not be sorry!!\", u'Date and Nut bars are becoming common.Cliff, Lara bars, Pure, and many smaller companies are making similar items.All have roughly 200 calories, and 11 to 20 grams of sugar.I prefer the Lara Bars since most of them are not as sweet as this Pure Organic bar was.The hint of Blue Berry in this bar is unique.The nuts provide a satisfying crunch.Live Strong does not have the nutritional information on this yet.', u'I like to have gluten free bars available for last minute snacks on the go. I normally eat Larabars, but these looked so good that I had to try them. They are delicious and I really appreciate the ingredient list. This is a quality product.', u'Not exactly stale but almost...not exactly fresh! That\\'s the way this bar tasted in my opinion. I shared it with my friend, who liked it no more than I did.  I did not taste cherries or cashews, but it is a cherry cashew bar. The first ingredient listed is dates. I like fresh-tasting dates. What would be wrong with mentioning dates in the name of the product? I like walnuts too. Aren\\'t many people allergic to walnuts? The bar is \"raw\"  with \"nothing cooked\" and \"nothing processed\" according to the label.  Yet it contains \"rice protein\" that must have been separated from the rest of the kernel. Was that process processing? The bar was sweet enough but not tasty enough to satisfy our taste buds. These are mere opinions.A few facts: \"Allergy statement: contains cashews, walnuts, almonds. This product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, wheat, peanuts, fish, tree nuts.\"  The bar weighs 1.7 ounces and contains 190 calories, including 70 fat calories. The label on the front says, \"Pure for all people.\"  The list price for 12 of these bars is $30.00, but it is selling on Amazon for $19.89. Shipping weight for twelve bars is 1.4 pounds. The product description says the bar has a \"good dose of vitamin C\" but the label says a serving of one bar provides 6% of the daily requirement of vitamin C.', u'When I opened up my first \"Pure Bar,\" I was unimpressed. It was sort of a small brown thing. Indeed, it only weighs 1.7 ounces (48g), a little on the small side for a \"granola\" or \"energy\" bar.Upon tasting it, however, I was pleasantly surprised. It is moist, chewy, satisfying, and unlike some \"blueberry\" products, really does have a taste of blueberry overall.Weighing in at 190 calories, I was satisfied for several hours after eating this bar. I ate it before teaching a 3 hour class, and was not hungry for the duration. 6 grams of protein surely helped in this.The package said it was a \"Raw fruit and nut bar,\" so I was expecting big chunks of nuts and a lot of chewing. Instead, there were only a few walnut chunks, and a pleasant lack of sugary goo holding it together. Whatever blending process was involved created a nicely palatable eating experience.For you ciliacs out there, this is also gluten-free. That said, non-ciliacs should not adopt a gluten-free diet for no reason - you\\'ll lose your tolerance if you avoid glutens.Everything in this bar is organic - which must explain the outrageous price. At an MSRP of two fifty per bar, this is a difficult value to justify, delicious as it is. You\\'d probably be better off buying loose nuts and dried fruits on your own, and you\\'d spend about a quarter of the money per gram of food as you would here.And this is too bad - because this is one tasty bar.', u\"I received both a blueberry and cherry Pure Bar.  The blueberry is much better.  Both are a little dry.  Both are not as sweet as other raw bars--which is actually  nice change.  I can't recommend the cherry one at all... but the blueberry one would be nice on occasion.  Can't see myself purchasing an entire box.I really think that if you're trying to eat healthfully... and want something that has real fruit and nuts in it... you're much much better off buying some dried or fresh cherries and nuts.  If you love dates, buy some medjool ones.  1000x healthier...most likely cheaper... much tastier....and just as convenient.  You don't need added agave and all the other nonsense.\", u'The first thing you should know about these bars, they are not granola bars. \"Raw fruit & nut bar\" sounds like it could be a light snack with big chunks of fruit and nuts, but this is much closer to a dense protein bar. Which is not a bad thing, so long as you are expecting it. Here are the details:* All organic ingredients! Very impressive resume here, which would fit any type of healthy lifestyle.* Flavor is good, only slightly sweet, and the occasional chunks of nuts are nice. Be aware that it contains dates, walnuts, cashews and almonds.* Size is good, may be a little smaller than you expect, but any bigger and you may start to feel full halfway through. Perfect size for a slightly heavy snack.* Calories are not bad at 190, compared to some other dense bars, but nutritional value is a little skewed for anyone looking for a healthy snack. At 190 calories, I hope for more than 4g of fiber and 6g of protein, especially when it packs 9g of fat. I enjoy many 100-140 calorie granola bars with less fat and more fiber.I prefer the tangy flavor of thePure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)over this blueberry one.This is a solid energy bar that would be well suited for a snack before/during a workout, long hike, intense bike ride, any kind of activity where a lighter granola bar would not be enough energy. I have eaten similar bars in the past (Cliff, Kashi GoLean, Zone, I forget how many others) and this is probably my favorite of the bunch. 4/5 stars only because I would expect more fiber in 190 calorie bar.', u\"For any person who cares about eating healthy, but likes to get their sweet cravings taking care of, these fit the bill. The ingredient list is very impressive, all organic, no refined sugars, and a short list.The bars are very sweet - even without refined sugars added, it is too sweet for my tastes.Superb ingredients, but too sweet and not my type. It might be an aquired taste - it is unlike any other bar you've eaten including: power bars, odwalla, granola bars, etc) it's soft, chewy, and very moist.If you kids like it - it's a much better alternative that other bars.\", u\"If you're interested in getting your hands on a chewy, healthy, satisfying little snack, definitely consider adding these to your shopping cart!The bars aren't large - about 1 1/4 inches wide by a little over 4 inches long, and about a half inch thick - but they're packed with good, fresh, healthy flavour. The bars are nicely chewy without being gummy, and have far more flavor and are far more palatable (in my opinion) than those fruit leather strips out there. These really are almost like a chewy fruit and nut brownie in the way they're made. I do have to say, though, that if you're not a walnut lover, beware, as walnuts are the nuts that I found in the greatest supply in my bar. As the ingredients list cites walnuts as one of the nuts used, after the fact I wasn't so surprised, but since they are called cherry cashew fruit and nut bars, I was expecting to see more cashews.As the ingredients and their prevalence go, they are listed as such on the bar (everything being organic, I'm going to skip typing that out seven times): dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein concentrate (whatever that is), walnuts, agave nectar, and almonds, all raw and unprocessed.Speaking of fruit leather, these bars are about that sort of color - reddish brown, with a look of pureed fruit that's had nuts mixed into it. I do like that these are certified organic, gluten-free, raw, vegan, and contain a full serving of fruit, plenty of omega 3 fatty acids, organic protein and 3 grams of fiber per bar. I have to say, though, that I'm not keen on the fact that each little bar has 8 grams of fat, but considering that they're nut fats, they're much healthier than the other fats that might make their way into your diet.Overall, I really enjoyed the bar that I tried. It was a satisfying sweet, chewy treat without being either too sweet or too tart. The perfect little dessert bite for a healthy lunch, or a delicious afternoon snack. If you happen to see these in your local grocery's health food section, pick one up to try it, then come back to Amazon and treat yourself to a whole bunch of 'em at a better price than you're apt to find locally!*UPDATE*Ever since I had that first cherry cashew Pure bar, I've thought about them often. I've seen them in my local Trader Joe's (which I'm an AVID fan of), as well as my local Kroger/Ralph's and a few other stores in their health food/protein & health bar aisles. I've continued to think about buying them there, but the prices that they sell them for in my local area put them at about $1.99 - $2.49 each, if not more. Being the frugal soul that I am, I just knew I'd find them for less here. At just under twenty bucks for a 12 count box, these work out to about $1.67 a bar here up front. If, however, you opt to subscribe to the product (which I often do on Amazon, at a twice-yearly shipment subscription), they come out to $1.40 per bar, WITH free shipping. Needless to say, I'm sold! My first box is on its way to me right now, and I'll be able to enjoy a delicious, sweet, chewy, HEALTHY dessert-like treat whenever I want one now! Yummy! Can't WAIT for my box to arrive!Try one! They're delicious!\", u\"This great tasting bar is a good treat. It's raw, organic, gluten free, vegan - and tastes good. What more could you want? It's similar in taste to other brands I've tried, but is a bit nuttier and denser. It's first ingredient is dates, which make a dense chewy bar, but there's enough cherries in it to give it a good cherry taste.  In addition to the nuts (cashews, walnuts and almonds) and fruit, there's organic rice protein concentrate. Not sure what that is - or how it is not cooked or processed, but yet concentrate? And also organic agave nectar.Not exactly a cheap snack, but not too bad for a raw organic one. And much more filling and satisfying than a candy bar - not to mention the health differences.\", u\"Okay, if you are a health nut or vegan, or into organics, this is for you.  It's certified organic, gluten free, rich in Omega 3's, raw, and Vegan.  It says it's a good source of fiber, but at 3 grams per serving, I'd say it's just an okay source of fiber.There are no refined sugars, no gluten, dairy, or soy, no cholesterol, no trans fats, to preservatives, or artificial anythings.There is also no flavor.  Unless you like to eat cardboard, which I don't.  Plus, it's about the size of my pinky, so you're not getting much.If I'm going to waste 200 calories on some kind of health bar, I'm going to make sure it tastes good.  Cherry or blueberry didn't matter, it still tasted bad, and the other benefits for me, weren't worth the calories.\", u\"This makes for a very satisfying, simple and delicious breakfast. The texture is moist and slightly chewy, while the flavor has the perfect balance of sweet and tart.I liked that it has a very short ingredient list, and that it's raw. Not because I'm on a raw diet or anything, it just keeps it from tasting 'fake' and gives me the satisfaction of having had a serving of fruit for the day.I would happily pick these up as a quick and easy meal replacement or snack option.\", u'The consistency and appearance of a chewy brownie, but cherry instead of chocolate, filled with nuts and just enough sweet to be satisfying. I could eat a half-dozen of these in the blink of an eye! I would definitely buy these, they would be great to carry along in a pocket.', u\"They're healthy and I found a great deal, but overall the texture is not my thing.  I do like the nuts in it.  I think the nuts saved the bar for me otherwise it was like a bulky, bland nutrition bar despite the presence of cherry flavor.  If whet fruit leather existed, this might be it.  I will not purchase this variety again, however it is edible and the taste kinda grows on you.  My boyfriend liked it and he doesn't normally like healthy stuff.\", u'THESE ARE THE BEST BARS EVER...I GOT THE CRANBERY ORANGE. I used to eat Larabars, but I got some that were state and I just got a bit tired of them. Then Amazon offerred these with a coupon!!!WOW, what a difference. So fresh, they are absolutely gooey and tasty. I can taste the Cranberries, then the Orange, then the cruch of Cashew! OH YUM. I am in Heaven. I have now ordered the BlueBerry and the Cherry. I am enthalled with these. Great fresh taste, small amount of calories...just right for a snack! About 180 calories. I love Muscle Milk when I am crashing through the day and want a fast meal, but for a snack, THESE are the best. Now on Subscribe and Save for me!!!CytoSport Muscle Milk Ready-to-Drink Shake, Strawberries and Creme, 12 - 14 Ounce Containers', u\"When I opened the wrapper I was a bit taken aback at how dark in color the bar was.  (I was expecting something lighter in color just because I'm used to lighter colored oats you find in granola bars.)The bar is very solid and dense, which I liked, so it felt like I was getting a real snack, and not just some airy, cheap bar.  The cherry flavor is pretty heavy making it a little sweet and it's well balanced out by the cashews in it.  (I really love cashews and I would have been OK with even more, but they nailed the combination of flavors.)When I took a bite into the bar my 7 year old wanted to try it so I let her.  On a child's taste buds she liked it at first bite, but after she had a chance to chew and swallow she was less enthusiastic and declined a second bite.I think this bar is for a more mature palate, but I suppose a child could get used to it.  It's definitely satisfying and above all, I love that it's organic and gluten free!\", u'This was very impressive.  As a snack, it\\'s basically mushed up dates with some cashews.  It has a VERY different consistency from grain based bars: imagine a sort of rolled-up fruit rollup, and you\\'ll come close.  The cashews add a nice crunch, and it has a very distinct cherry flavor.For someone trying to eat naturally, it\\'s tough to get any better!  Though what \"Rice Protein Concentrate\" is, I\\'m not sure, and I don\\'t think it really needs any added sweetening from the agave and would prefer to see raw honey instead, or no sweeteners at all.  (There are some controversies around agave, apparently.)I\\'m interested in trying other flavors: apparently, Amazon also sells a variety pack!', u\"I received this as part of the Amazon Vine and only got one bar to try. So I cannot say if the flavor is consistent between bars and I cannot judge if all are supposed to taste like this.As advertised, this is an Organic & Raw product. So if you have never had raw cashews, cherries or dates, you may not get the flavor you expect, especially with the cashews. Most people are used to them salted and roasted. In this bar, the dates and walnuts were the dominate flavor, not the cherries or the cashews. It tasted more like a raisin walnut bar, than a cherry cashew bar.The bar is a little small compared to most snack bars, about an inch and a half by three inches and the package is a little deceptive in that is larger than the bar by over an inch.Overall, I can't give it a high rating since the Cherry and Cashew flavor is dominated by the Date and Walnut. And as I said, I only have one bar to try, so I don't know if others are better, but for the price I would expect the flavor listed to be correct and the bars to be a bit bigger.\", u'Honestly, one of the best \"power bar\" type bars I\\'ve ever had.Liked the taste and the texture. Most power bars are heavy on the protein to the point of being rubbery and hard as a rock (difficult to eat). Not so this one. It was chewy and relatively soft. I quite enjoyed it.The box maxes several claims such as \"organic,\" \"non-GMO,\" \"raw\"/\"uncooked,\" \"good source of omega 3.\" I\\'m not qualified to evaluate all the claims. But the ingredient list seems quite clean / healthy and without any significant preservatives or additives. So, it seems rather healthy. Seeing as how it seems to use plenty of fruits, nuts and other various healthy things.In all I\\'d give this one a thumbs up. I\\'d say it\\'s probably good as a snack on hikes, or with lunches. I could certainly see eating these under a variety of circumstances. But again more as a snack, since I don\\'t think one or two would completely sate hunger. Might tide you over for a little while. I did end up eating a bowl of cereal shortly afterward. So, like I said, it seems like it would complement a meal, as opposed to replacing one. Does have a pretty high sugar content on account of the fruits used, of course.', u\"The Pure bar advertises itself as nothing but pure, raw, fruits and nuts, which is true, though a tiny bit misleading, as there's a healthy dose of added sugar in the form of agave syrup, which is boiled down from raw agave. Agave does sound exotic, and suggestive of all sorts of healing properties, but truth be told it's not terribly different from corn syrup at the nutritional level- it consists of anywhere from 56% to 92% fructose, with the remainder being glucose, and trace amounts of flavor compounds.The bulk of the bar is dried dates, nuts, and cherries, ground up and formed into something that looks rather like the inside of a Fig Newton bar. As for taste... well, it tastes rather like the inside of a Fig Newton bar. GIven that these cost, on a per ounce basis, about five times what Fig Newtons cost, I'd expect something a bit tastier. If you're looking for a healthy snack, you can buy your own dried fruits and nuts for half the cost of these, and I'll bet they'll taste a heck of a lot better, too.\", u\"There are very few organic foods that can really taste the way they advertise, and are absolutely worth the money. That definitely is the case with Pure Bars. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious their Organic Cherry Cashew Fruit & Nut bars really are. The price is well worth the money, and the taste is delicious. The bar really tastes like you're eating a fresh and ripe cherry. While I honestly wish I could've tasted more of the other fruits in the bar and the nuts like the cashews. Nevertheless, if you want to find a snack that is absolutely delightful for the kids, than the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew is absolutely worth the effort.Price: B+Taste: A-Overall: B+\", u'Let\\'s get something clear here:  I am just fine with eating food that isn\\'t organic, I\\'m not gluten free and I\\'m not on a raw diet.Short Version:  If you have dietary requirements for one or more of the above, these are GREAT.  Get them.  Eat them.  You\\'ll be happy with them.  I have a number of friends like you and I think they\\'ll be all over these things.  If you don\\'t have said dietary requirements?  These are still pretty good, you should try them.Long Version:The bar is pleasantly moist, it has the texture of a really dense carrot cake.  It doesn\\'t taste anything like carrot cake, though there do appear to be carrots in it.The flavor is like a not-too-sweet not-artificial-tasting blueberry muffin.I had a very long drive and I didn\\'t want to stop for food or buy junk when I stopped for gas, I also had plans to eat when I got to my destination which meant I\\'d be eating lunch a bit later then I normally do.  So I took one of these bars, a couple pieces of fruit and a bottle of water with me.  The bar seemed small when I took it out of the package, but it\\'s heavy for it\\'s size.  It didn\\'t crumble and make a mess, it was chewy without making me have to work to break it down, and when combined with my bottle of water I actually felt... Full isn\\'t the right word.  I wasn\\'t hungry and I didn\\'t feel weighed down by it.  A few hours after that I arrived and I was ready to eat but I wasn\\'t \"I\\'m going to gnaw your arm off if you don\\'t get me some food NOW!\" either.A friend of mine, who was with me, also had one.  He said he thought it needed salt.  But he thinks everything needs salt, so we\\'ll just ignore him.', u'My annual ritual is to look in the mirror, decide it is time to shed my \"winter coat\", lose weight and eat better. This started last month and when I got the opportunity to order this, I jumped on it. Healthy, purely organic, who could beat that promise? Especially when I have tried several other protein bars, and found only one other that I like (Luna bar). Although I usually go for the chocolate/peanut butter because the taste and texture seem to be acceptable to my tastebuds, I thought that a cherry protein bar would be interesting. The bar wasn\\'t too sweet (as a matter of fact, not sweet at all), and does offer a somewhat pleasant cherry taste. The only thing that I was not \"wild\" about was the texture, but true protein bar lovers, won\\'t mind that at all. Did it satisfy me as a healthy snack? Yes, although I am not sure that I would run out and buy tons of them for my regular snack between meals, but as an occassional fruit treat, I will definitely consider it.', u\"Like a dessert meal bar. The chocolate in these is some of the best I've ever tasted and even my picky husband was could eating them. So recommended!\", u\"I picked this bar because I like having them around the house for a quick snack. I also tried the blueberry, which impressed me less. What I enjoyed about the cherry cashew is that it had more flavor than the blueberry and wasn't overly sweet. In fact, there was a nice little tart kick. I like the ingredient list, although I've read there is some controversy about agave nectar. I offered my husband a taste, and he didn't want to try it since he doesn't like cherries. He'd tried the blueberries and was less than impressed. Finally, he agreed to have a nibble, and said that he liked it, and definitely preferred it to the blueberry. So, the bar converted a cherry hater. :)I'd purchase this flavor again, definitely.\", u\"This was a very nice organic bar. Not what I expected. Some of these can be gritty and make you feel like you're eating flavored sand. This wasn't like that. Great taste. Great texture. I'd order more for sure.\", u'Upon opening the wrapper, I noticed that the inside of it looked as though the bar had sweated profusely while on its trip to my home. Not a promising sign. The bar itself looked very unappealing, like something that had been made with an industrial extruder into which someone threw blueberries, oats and other healthy-type food. At least it smelled edible. The bar is definitely blueberry flavor, but with a twist. Imagine if you had a piece of blueberry pie while you were out at a nice hillside picnic. Now imagine that you dropped your pie piece and it rolled down the hill and into a nearby forest, all the while collecting dirt, leaves, twigs and other detritus. Now eat that pie. That is what this bar tastes like.', u\"Unfortunately, all the reviews are mixed together regardless of flavor.  This is a pretty significant problem since some are great, and some, not so much.  I give it 5 stars because the quality is there, the rest is just catering to your tastes.My first Pure bar was the Wild Blueberry.  They are fine for what they are. Blueberries, cashews and almonds. I like them well enough that I bought again, and will continue.I then tried the Chocolate Brownie with primary ingredients of cocoa and walnuts.  Once again, they are fine. Compared to other dreadful bars out there, they are good.I tried Larabars, which are similar, but ultimately don't like them.  The only other bars I like are the Kind series.  But, they are not exactly bars. The are just nuts formed together in hardened syrup.  Still good if you want the crunch of nuts.  But Pure Bars are actual bars that taste like a treat.  Something to keep you away from the candy aisle.With that said, I've pretty much said these are &#34;fine&#34;.. not great.  I've been endlessly waiting for &#34;great&#34;.  Well, I finally found my Pure match in Dark Chocolate Berry.  Raspberries, cranberries, almonds and cocoa. So very good, I'm getting more right now.  When was the last time you have looked forward to one of these kind of bars?  I can't say that I have.  I will continue getting the blueberry bars, as they are appealing in the morning.  But my problem is wanting to be bad at night. And this brings out my dark side in all the right ways.I still want to try the coconut options of Cashew Coconut and Banana Coconut.  And I notice the variety pack contains the three I mentioned, and banana coconut. So that will be a good choice, just in case I don't love it, I will like the rest.  But if you are considering any of these, I highly suggest the variety pack to get you started.\", u'Usually products like this tend to be bland with a mixture of ingredients that are blended to a pulp.  The Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry bar was a surprise.  It had a pleasant blueberry taste and the walnuts were not minced into sawdust, but were clearly scattered through the bar in good size pieces.  The texture is much like a Fig Newton, but more moist.  This is not a huge portion, but it is a great snack.', u'Really great snack, you know its healthy when your eating it.  Too bad they are a bit expensive because I would subscribe an get them all the time.', u\"This bar tastes OK, but it won't change your life.  The mouth feel is a little 'chewerier' than I like, but I think this is a healthy product at a fair price\", u'I was sooooo glad to find a natural raw agave sweetened bar.  It is very difficult to find this quality anywhere.', u'I like the premise of these bars (raw, organic) enough to consider trying another flavor sometime, but cherry was not a hit at my house. The main ingredient is dates, and the bar is very dark, with almost a molasses-type flavor. The cherries are tangy, which is good, but the agave sweetener makes the whole thing too sweet.  There are 17 grams of sugar despite the fact that the bar is tiny.  Dried fruit (which this basically seems to be) has a LOT of sugar already.  You\\'d really be better off eating fresh fruit.Along those lines, the nutrition from this bar is very poor; don\\'t be tricked into thinking it\\'s \"healthy.\" While it does contain 12% of your daily fiber, there\\'s also 12% of your daily fat (and did I mention these bars are tiny?!).  Then, drum roll please, it contains very little of anything else. Vitamin A (0%); vitamin C (6%). Nothing is higher than 6%.Bottom line, this is probably better for you than a bag of Cheetos, but not by all that much, and you may have a hard time selling it to your kids.', u'My 2 year old son loves these Apple Cinnamon \"snack\" bars. They are great on the go as a healthy alternative with no processed or cooked ingredients. Just bought the variety pack and he loves the blueberry bars too (just placed my order for a 12 pack). Testing out the others.  :O)', u'As a health food nut and raw food fan, I\\'ve tried countless healthful bars that were supposed to take the place of real candy bars.  Most of them are not really that healthful; when you look at the ingredients list, they have various types of sugars disguised as health foods (not!) and processed ingredients that do not benefit the health in any way.  The ones that are actually healthful tend to taste lousy--either too sweet, too cardboard-like, or too bland.This bar is different.  One bite, and I thought, \"Wonder if there\\'s anyplace nearby that carries these.\"  They contain nothing cooked and nothing processed, so already they\\'re a step ahead of most of the fare available at health food stores and in grocery health food aisles.  Moreover, they taste great!  They really taste like cherries--no, not those maraschino cherries they put in mixed drinks, loaded with dyes and sugar--but real cherries.  They\\'re delightfully chewy, have some organic rice protein in them to keep your blood sugar from skyrocketing, and to top it off, they\\'re gluten-free, certified organic, and rich in omega-3s and fiber.  They\\'re raw and vegan.  If you\\'ve ever tried a bar that meets those criteria, I can virtually guarantee it didn\\'t taste like this one.  Yes, it does have 17 grams of sugar, and that\\'s a lot, but it\\'s all natural sugar, and most natural bars similar to it have more.  It\\'s the amount of natural sugar you would get from eating a small serving or two of cherries and a couple of handfuls of nuts.I don\\'t believe people need to give up the good life to go raw, natural, and organic; bars like this one prove me right!', u'This bar is perfect as a snack. However, keep in mind that it is low in protein (6 grams), whereas there are many bars out there that are organic and have 20 grams of protein.', u'I tried both the Wild Blueberry flavor and the Cherry Cashew flavor so I cannot help but compare the two.  I also had my kids try them both to get their opinions (which were strong) and I will share those also.  The Wild Blueberry was tried after the Cherry Cashew which was a good thing.  The Cherry Cashew was pretty tart and the kids didn\\'t care for it much (they are 8 and 11 yrs old).  The Wild Blueberry, however, was a hit.  Personally, I liked both but I like tart things and so it wasn\\'t an issue for me like it was for the kids.  The Wild Blueberry was definitely sweeter.  I am surprised that they didn\\'t put \"Almond\" in the name of this bar as it is a prevalent flavor--especially since they mention the cashews in the title of the Cherry Cashew bar.  I think \"Blueberry Almond\" would probably be a better name for this bar.  The packaging seems pretty standard and shows what the creator of the bar (Veronica)looks like in a cartoon version on the front.It is gluten free and full of organic, organic, organic (almost every ingredient has the word \"organic\" before it).All in all, the Wild Blueberry Pure Organic Bar is tasty, sweet, and appeals to the kids.  I would definitely recommend it as a snack or a quick breakfast (it is pretty filling!).  I give this bar four stars.', u\"Despite being advertised as a raw product, this snack bar has the texture of an oatmeal cookie with nutty chunks. However, the flavor surges in your mouth as sweet and tart as that first kiss from the bad boy your folks didn't approve of in high school. One bite and it is obvious--this isn't that horrible pallid fake cherry flavor they use in medicine, but the real, vivid fruit: sweet to the tongue but tart enough to make the eyes squint. Your teeth will enjoy crunching through the chunks of walnut, which adds its own distinctive flavor--a little bland and dark--the perfect offset to the bright sunshine of the cherry. Bite into and remember romance. Everything here is perfectly healthy so this isn't forbidden fruit...\", u'I like the ingredients on this snack bar:  Organic Dates, Organic Cashews, Organic Cherries Organic Rice Protein Concentrate, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds.  That\\'s it.  I can pronounce all of it.  The bar has a nice texture: kind of chewy but not a major workout for the jaw.  The nuts give you a little crunch; the cherries add a nice tartness.  The overall flavor was a little flat but definitely not tasteless - I enjoyed it.It is a little high in carbohydrates and fats but it\\'s made mostly from dates and nuts so that should be expected.  They\\'re natural \"fruit\" carbs (agave, dates and cherries) and \"good\" fats (from nuts).  One bar is 190 calories with 8g fat, 25g carbohydrates (3g Fiber -yay!, 17g sugars) and 7g Protein.', u\"Tastes great, it's organic and a great value! Not too much else to say, I would rate this very highly in the organic food bar market.\", u\"This cherry cashew bar is heavy, feels like it weighs more than the 1.7 ounces it states on the package.The bar is a dark brown, which reminds of chocolate or fig.  You can plainly see the cashews on the outside, as well as on the inside of the bar.It does have a tart taste, probably from the cherries.  It also has an oily feel to the bar.It's ok, but I don't think I would buy this on a regular basis, if at all.I really didn't care for the taste.\", u'I like organic and raw energy bars. In the past there were very little choices as only a few small manufacturer were producing them. Lately there has been a proliferation of organic and raw products on the market.Some of the negatives that I have experienced from some raw fruit and nut bars BUT NOT THIS ONE were:-Bad taste not very appealing-Poor texture not easy to chew-Gas forming by improper mix of ingredients-Not sweet enough or too sweetThis PURE bar was just right. The blueberry flavor was distinct and the nuts were sized right and tasted good mixed in with the fruits. There was not a bad aftertaste and the bar supplied me with extra energy for several hours. The ingredients were organic and raw. The shelf life was 1 year which seems a little long for not having any preservatives. I would refrigerate them to make them last longer even though that is not required.All in all this is a good product in my opinion. I am now curious as to how their other bars taste.', u\"This bar was not what I expected, but I apparently just didn't read the description that closely.  I was expecting a granola-type bar with cherry and cashew in it, but this is gluten-free, and so there is nothing like that in it.The ingredients, which are all organic, are: dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein concentrate, walnuts, agave nectar and almonds.  There are 3 grams of fiber in every bar, so it's a good source of fiber.  Sugar is pretty high at 17grams per bar, although they are naturally occurring fruit sugars.  Each bar is 190 calories and contains 8 grams of fat.I personally felt the bar was too sweet for my tastes and I couldn't taste the cashews at all.  I love cashews and it was the sole reason I chose this bar, but I was disappointed.  My husband and 10 year old daughter also tried the bar and weren't impressed either, and they generally eat the fruit cereal bars on a regular basis.Although this might be a good product for some, it doesn't meet our expectations.\", u'These bars are delicious! They\\'re made of raw, certified organic ingredients, they\\'re gluten-free, and vegan (so no dairy or eggs). They also made without nasty stuff such as palm oil or corn syrup. I was reminded a little of another brand called \"Larabars\" -- and that\\'s a good thing. After tasting the Cherry Cashew flavor, I want to try some of the others.', u\"everyone at work loved the variety. there were some that liked the fruit and some that liked the chocolate and some that liked both. they taste a little bit stale sometimes but what can you expect from a packaged food. in general I like that it's made from nuts and dates and it doesn't have a lot of things that I wouldn't want to eat.\", u'so yummy! my kids and i have these as snacks . they are very moist and chewy. absolutely delicious, not too sweet. the size is fine too, in my opinion.', u'What an unpleasant taste and texture! This is a little brown bar, very flat and solid, and it tastes like compressed fruitcake, only not sweet. It smells and tastes like some kind of dried fruit. What is the sweetener here, prune juice? IS there a sweetener here? It\\'s foods like this that give \"natural foods\" a bad name. Cherries and cashews are delicious--how did they get THIS bar out of those delicious foods? This was gross, I\\'m sorry.', u\"I had low expectations as I'm usually not a fan of health food bars.  These, however, were quite good.  I enjoyed the slightly chewy texture and the fresh nuts.  The bars have a bright and fruity flavor that is very pleasant.  I also tried the blueberry, but preferred the tart flavor of these a little more. I would definitely buy these again.\", u'The taste of this bar is OK but not that great. I guess it is just a matter of preference. I have tasted other organic fruit and nut bars and they had a lot more flavor. The ingredients are good for you but with not nuch flavor.', u\"This is one of the best I've ever tasted and I've been looking for someplace to purchase it ever since.  Try it if you like cherry and cashew, you won't be disappointed, until you try to find another!\", u'The field of snack bars is a crowded one. These bars distinguish themselves by being \"pure,\" i.e., primarily composed of organic raw fruits and nuts. I was provided a sample to review for the Vine program.  Here\\'s the rundown:Pros:(1) Indisputably healthy and good for you.(2) Substantial--quite chewy, and one bar will last you a while,(3) Organic. No artificial pesticides etc. Yay earth.(4) Loaded with vitamins and minerals. See point (1).(5) Not all that high in calories (190 for the bar we samples), compared to other snack bars.(6) They\\'re not as dry and crumbly as, say, granola bars are.(7) Gluten free, for those it matters to.Cons:(1) Negative eye appeal. These things just don\\'t look appetizing.(2) They *taste* indisputably healthy and good for you.  I rather liked them, especially given the chewiness factor, but I let my two children try a bite, and they were unimpressed.In sum, I think these would be great to carry on backpacking trips, and I like that they don\\'t crumble into a million pieces when you try to eat them. They wouldn\\'t be my first choice of snack (chocolate chip cookies, anybody?), but maybe they *should* be.', u\"While I'd certainly appreciate one of these if I was stranded on a desert island with nothing else to eat, it's highly unlikely I'll be picking up a pack of them anytime soon at the local grocery store. I found them to be a bit dry and not nearly as flavorful as I'd expected based on the raw, organic ingredients. For Vegans and those who need to avoid refined sugar, transfats, cholesterol, gluten or soy, etc. these are probably a good snack choice but I didn't personally find them appealing.\", u'Yes, it may claim to be all organic and such...but, yuck! This is the worst bar I have ever had. I am always looking for a good, healthy, organic AND tasty bar, but this...tasted like cardboard, with a nut here and there. I have eaten two of these, and the first one was so bad that the second one made me gag. I love theClif ZbarandKashi. They are tasty, this is not.Although the list of ingredients sounds good (health wise) and the flavor says cherry chashew, it asll tasted disgusting to me. If you are looking for a vegan/organic bar that actually DOES taste like what it is supposed to be, check outPROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar, Strawberry. The Fruition is seriosuly yummy. With a capital Y, the good Y.', u'Very tasty fruit/snack bar. It had a very distinct cherry taste with no bad after taste. I also liked the fact that it was organic.', u'I am not big on energy bars or health bars. This does not taste that great. It is a good health choice but I like the fig nut-tons better. I overall think if you like organic or want a healthy snack this is fine. Since its all natural kids might like it.', u\"Well now, here we have yet another healthy bar to snack on, but unfortunately this bar has very little taste and what taste it does have is nothing I would want to eat. I'm all for healthy eating, but we live only once and I prefer to eat something that taste good. It has the consistency of a fruit roll up without being very sweet. The bar has an slightly sour taste and the nuts are soft(yuck!). There are numerous better tasting bars on the market that are healthy so as a food source this would only be eaten if all other food  disappeared off the planet!\", u\"Overall, the Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit and Nut Bar was pretty good.  It was a little dry in my opinion.  It isn't very sweet almost more salty from the cashews.  If you are looking for a not too sweet snack, you will probably enjoy it.  It has a good flavor overall, but it was not outstanding in any way.  It is a cherry outside with cashews intertwined throughout.  Each bar has 190 calories and 8 grams of fat.  It has 25g of carbs overall and contains several important nutrients.  In my opinion, it was only slightly healthier than a candy bar.  The draw is that it is certified organic.  If you are looking for an organic snack, you could give this a try.\", u'This Raw Fruit & Nut Bar is certified organic, gluten-free, a full serving of fruit, it\\'s raw, vegan, etc. etc.  The flavor I received was Wild Blueberry.  Now, what I didn\\'t realize is that the bar\\'s first ingredient on the ingredients listing is Organic Dates.  Just the sound of \"organic dates\" makes me not like the bar.Sorry folks, I think this just tastes like bland nuts, cardboard, and a hint of blueberry flavor.  However, it gets three SOLID stars because it is clearly organic, natural, raw, and good for you.  If you\\'re into this sort of thing I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY recommend it.It contains cashews, walnuts, almonds, and is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, and tree nuts (all according to the product label).Go for it!  Give it a try.  Why not?!', u\"Unlike many energy bars, this delicious fruit and nut bar is not laden with corn syrup or other junk.  The ingredient list on Amazon's web site is out of date. The main ingredient is dates, followed by cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, then blueberries blended with apple juice concentrate, and sunflower oil.  Then comes agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. All the ingredients are organic.  There is a good aftertaste, and the small serving size is a satisfying amount. Even though I don't care for dates nor walnuts, I still enjoyed the flavor.\", u'I am considering buying a box of these. I like the taste and found it filling.', u\"While I enjoyed eating the bar I received (both the cherry cashew and blueberry flavors), I have to say that I doubt I'd purchase these in any quantity.  While the overall caloric content of these bars isn't bad (190 calories), the fat and carb content is high (naturally, given the nuts and fruit in the bars) and protein content relatively low.  I already get plenty of fiber from whole foods and enjoy eating fresh fruit with yogurt, cottage cheese, and oatmeal as well as by itself, so I don't feel the need to up my intake of fruits by eating a bar like this.  If only it had some added protein I might have been able to give it a higher recommendation.\", u'This bar is on the \"chewy\" side; it\\'s tasty but not overly sweet.  One bar has 190 calories; 70 calories from fat. Total fat per bar is 8 grams, zero saturated. They contain no cholesterol and no sodium. Total carbs per bar = 26 grams and each bar has 3 grams of fiber. Each bar also has 19 grams of sugars, but it is footnoted that the sugars are only natural fruit sugars. One bar also has 6 grams of protein.The bars are also certified organic, gluten free, nothing cooked, nothing artificial, nothing processed. To top it all off, it is made in the good old USA (Holland, Michigan)If you want a snack bar, I really don\\'t see how you can beat this one in regard to quality, heathly ingredients, and taste.My only complaint is that I got this via the Amazon Vine program and I thought I was going to get 12 bars and only got one!  Now I actually have to buy more!  And that I will...for me as well as for my kids...this is one snack I will be happy to see them eat.', u'okay if I had seen what the bar looks like I probably would not have chosen it.It has a typical protein bar look (glossy plastic looking surface)However, the texture is not grainy and does not have an undercooked flour taste/textureHas a good blend of fruity and nutty taste.Overall the bar is filling and tastes good with no odd after taste.', u'A bar is one serving and 190 calories. It tastes good and really does remind me of a Christmas fruitcake (In a good way). Plenty of blueberries (and organic apple juice concentrate) to make it taste sweet. There are cashews, walnuts and almonds for crunch. Over all its a decent tasting bar. 3g fiber, 26g total carbs, 8g total fat but no trans fat and only 0.5g sat fat, no sodium & no cholest.', u'I like the texture and taste of these. They are a heavy/dense little bar, but moist and that surprised me. I liked the amount of cashews and might have even liked a little less cherry - at times they seemed a little sour. Overall I was surprised that they were so good though. They look bland and yucky in appearance, but I think they taste pretty good and I could see myself eating more of them if they were a little healthier and less pricey. To me it seems no different than buying an expensive candy bar in terms of cost and nutrition.', u'The \\'Pure - Organic Wild Blueberry Bar\\' is an excellent snack.  It is soft because it is not cooked/baked.  Everything is \"raw\".  I believe the glue that holds this bar together are the organic dates.  It is mildly sweetened by Organic Agave Nectar.  There are a lot of nuts, mostly cashews and walnuts, but a few almonds are hiding in there.  The taste reminds me of a very soft and rich blueberry muffin.My package is labeled Kosher by the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, Organic by Quality Assurance International, and certified Gluten-Free.  It obviously contains nuts and is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, and fish.The makers are a proud sponsor of the Celiac Disease Foundation.', u\"This bar has the consistency of a dense cake and I thought it tasted really good but not so much like cherries. More sweet and slightly tangy. I didn't think it tasted like dates as some reviewers have claimed. I, personally, hate the taste of dates so if I had tasted that I would not have given it a good review. It has a good quanity of nuts in the bar so it does have crunch, whereas some bars I have tasted claim to have nuts they chop them up so fine I can't even tell they are there this bar leaves them in good-sized bites. Overall, this was a tasty, healthy snack.\", u\"I have mixed feelings on this product, I liked it but did not love it enough to want to go out and buy some (at least not fo this particular flavor).  I thought the taste was ok, although I would have preferred a stronger blueberry taste and more actual blueberries in the bar - the few that I saw were hard to find.I did like all of the different kinds of nuts, and the fact that they used agave nectar to sweeten rather than processed/refined sugar, and I very much like the concept that they are using ingredients that are 'raw' and not overly processed or cooked.I wasn't very crazy about the texture at first, but by the time I was done I didn't mind it.  It has a very dense, solid, somewhat 'mucky' texture which I'm sure is due to the agave nectar that is holding all of the ingredients together.If I were looking to purchase a snack bar I don't think I would be very likely to reach for one of these, although my 2 year old didn't hesitate to eat the piece that I offered her and asked for more.\", u'I liked it mostly because it has a nice balance to its taste--not overly sweet like some \"health\" snack bars , not too dry, not too chewy, and reasonably filling as well.  At a buck and a half each, I think it\\'s pretty competitive with most comparable bars.  It has an assortment of vitamins--but not a whole lot of each one.  Still its 190 calories, with 70 fat calories.  It\\'s certified organic by Quality Assurance International--even supplying an address & phone number.  Good for me--no gluten or milk.', u\"These are the best brownies that I've had and the best organic product I've tried.  Unfortunately I will have to limit my purchases because their too expensive.  These are organic and not cooked or processed.  I would still rather pay more if I could afford it to buy these organic brownies. You'll definitely want to try.  I hesitated to buy these but I'm glad I did.  I expected some dry or dull tasting organic snack but their as good as real brownies just not as sugary but definitely sweet because of the natural sugar from the dates and organic agave nectar which has a lower glycemic count than sugar.  Their very moist, sweet, but not sweet like a refined sugar.  Package says certified usda organic so i'm hoping they are truely organic but I'm very wary even when they label them especially with some organic companies using unfiltered city water which is not safe and in some cases fluoridated.  No thanks on the fluoride.\", u'I was pleasantly surprised by the intense and varied flavor of this bar, given that it contains only raw and natural ingredients (and by natural, they mean NATURAL.  There are no vague ingredients like \"other natural flavors.\"  The ingredients listed above in the description are all that are in it.  I didn\\'t even know it was possible to make a bar without artificial preservatives, that still has an expiration date that isn\\'t until next year!I am not on a raw food diet, nor am I a vegetarian or vegan, but I can say that with these bars handy to grab in the morning, I will be happy to switch at least ONE meal a day to raw food vegan!  I didn\\'t even know products like these were available.I got one bar free as a sample, and NEVER expected to purchase more.  I am back on Amazon today to buy a whole box of these!By the way, if you don\\'t like TART flavors, you won\\'t like this. The dried cherries (coupled with a lack of refined added sugar) make for a very naturally tart bar.  Personally, I like it that way -- enough with the dull \"beige\" flavoring in many processed foods!  :-)Oh, and one added bonus -- unlike with other bars, I didn\\'t feel hungry an hour later.  People have commented on the bars being too small, but I think they are just right (at least for me).  Actually, all bars like this tend to be small, it\\'s just that some are longer and skinnier, which makes them seem bigger.  I\\'ve noticed that the weight is about the same - it\\'s just that Pure\\'s bar is short and thick, and that makes it seem so smaller.UPDATE:I liked these enough to buy a box (also bought the apple cinnamon, which I also like a lot.)  I find that I like the taste of them even more if I store them in the refrigerator.  Yum...especially as the summer heat is coming!  :-)', u'Bars get a bad rap, and usually for good reason.  I\\'ll admit to using \"diet\" bars many times to simplify weight loss or as quick meals.  Calorie content in those bars tends to be fine, but that\\'s about it.  They are full of sugar and preservatives and somehow make me feel both gross and hungry when I eat them.  Though I understand the philosophy of \"everything in moderation,\" I think I\\'ve found something better in the Pure bars.  Calories are similar (190), but the ingredients are completely different.  Rather than being similar to a candy bar, these Pure bars are a simple mix of fruits and nuts, along with rice protein and agave nectar.  All of it is raw, organic, and straightforward, to the extent that it really tastes like something I\\'d make for myself.  The consistency is smooth and dense, with some nut chunks to add a bit of texture.  The blueberry flavor and consistency is pleasant and reminds me of fresh blueberries, rather than the somewhat metallic artificial blueberry flavor found in many munchies I\\'ve munched on.There are no mysteries to these bars, so I think you can make a pretty good guess at whether they fit into your life or not.  If they do, the only question is if it is worth the cost for the convenience or if you\\'d rather make your own.', u'These, (Dark Chocolate Berry Bars), are SO good... even the husband likes them :o Yes - they probably could be just a Little less sweet, but it certainly doesn\\'t stop us from savoring every bite. Love the textures, and the flavor and that they are \"healthy\", or at least \"healthier\" ;) and that you can get a little protein thrown in there as well, and that is NOT soy or whey! Huzzah!!', u'Reminded me of a brownie .Blueberry flavor definitely dominates the other ingredients. The calorie count however makes this more of a meal replacement bar than a snack for for the diet conscious.', u\"I'm a big fan of blueberry anything. I wasn't disappointed with the flavor. It had a pretty good, though not great, taste to it. The bar is soft and chewy and most bars like this are. I tend to go more towards bars that offer mor protein, but the fiber content is good. For those that enjoy fruit bars such as nutrigrain bars, this would be a good alternative.\", u\"I tried both the blueberry and the cherry versions.  Although I really like Blueberry and the health benefits of the blueberry are unsurpassed, I have to say I liked the cherry cashew bar better.This is an extremely nice and convenient little bar.  The taste of the cherry is wonderfully good-reminiscent of the intensely flavorful  Montmorency Cherries with a superior texture and quality.The cashew of the bar adds a nice balance to the cherry. The nuttiness lends a nice chewiness to the bar, keeping it from an overly soggy texture.These bars are a very enjoyable treat.  It's nice to have something like this at your desk-keep your hands clean, while keeping those hunger pangs away!The ingredients list is also very good. The emphasis on organic ingredients insure that this food is chemical and pesticide -free.\", u\"This is a great little raw bar with a strong blueberry flavor, from organic wild blueberries. It's a very high quality product, all organic, and provides 6 grams of protein, 190 calories, 3 grams of fiber, and 19 grams of sugar from agave nectar.  I liked the chewy texture and the added nutrition and flavor from the walnuts.\", u\"I tried several of these bars, but I had to hold my breath to take a bite -- they smell terrible! Like vinegar or something. Most unpleasant. The taste isn't bad, but it ain't a chocolate brownie, I don't care what any of the other reviews say!\", u'Pure Organic Wild Blueberry / Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.  Nothing Cooked.  Nothing processed.  That\\'s what the package says, and I was skeptical from the start.  First, opening the package I noticed it had a funny smell (like off gassing), but it quickly went away.  The look?  Not all that appealing, really, but neither are PowerBars and Clif Bars. So moving onto the taste... it was just \"okay.\" I wasn\\'t wowed by it, but I didn\\'t think it was bad, either.  I felt satisfied, but I had to chase it down with some water.Honestly, I probably won\\'t buy another one.  The one I tasted was a free sample, but I would have probably bought one to try.  I should note that I\\'ve eaten my share of energy bars in my days, and I\\'ve never found one that fit my criteria of being both healthy and tasting good;  I either find one, but not the other.  So the search continues...', u'The ingredient list is very impressive - natural and simple. I wasn\\'t sure how it was going to taste since it\\'s labeled \"raw.\" I was pleasantly surprised - it\\'s mildly sweet and fruity (in a natural way of course). There is some minimal nutty texture from the real nuts. The only disappointment is that the bar itself is surprisingly small, which will be discovered once you open the package. Other than that, this bar can probably be recommended since it seems natural and healthful - good for any occasion maybe. Just don\\'t expect it to really fill you up or sustain you for long!', u'This bar was advertised as a raw, uncooked food bar, gluten free. Initial impression upon eating the bar was that there was a good strong smell and taste of blueberry, without that blueberry flavor being cloying and artificial as it sometimes is with a blueberry muffin. The bars were about 190 calories each and every ingredient was labeled as \"Organic\". 8 grams (70kcal) of fat, probably from the nuts and the Sunflower oil. They tasted like something you\\'d want to eat.  At 26 grams of carbs per bar, with only 2 grams of fiber, and 19 grams of sugar, this bar might not fit into your diet.  But my wife thought that two of these with a bottle of water would make a great 400 calorie lunch with zero prep.  A bar was about the size of six monopoly dice. and was 1.7 us OZ or 48 grams (come on, folks, round numbers - 2 US ounces or 50 grams).The five star rating came solely from the taste and mouthfeel.They claimed that there was \"nothing cooked\" in the bar.  I found that confusing.  Concentrates, like Orange Juice Concentrate, are cooked - they are heated until the water reduces. I likve near plants that produce such concentrate, and it is cooked. These bars contain, for example, \"Organic rice protein concentrate\", \"Organic apple concentrate\" and \"organic lemon juice concentrate. I put that those ingredients have to be cooked to be concentrated, or at least processed, and the \"Organic Rice Protein Concentrate\" has to be cooked or processed, somehow, to separate the rice protein from the rice starch.  According to the product FAQ page the brown rice protein (arguably not this rice protein) protein is raw because their supplier uses a natural enzyme to separate the protein from the carbohydrate bur the label claims \"nothing processed\" and the use of an enzyme has to count as processing.Now, they do claim to be gluten free, and nothing that is listed as an ingredient in the bar should be a source of gluten.  They support the Celiac Disease foundation openly on their label - so if you are afflicted with celiac, you might want to carry these tasty little bars with you for an afternoon pick-me-up or even a meal replacement.I got my bar free from the Vine program.  I think I\\'m gonna go out and get me a couple of these, if I can find them for less than $3 each.', u'Good quality ingredients--a very healthy product. Just not crazy about the texture--a bit sticky. That said, not crazy about any food bars--I would rather have a handful of gorp.', u\"I really liked the taste of these, and I appreciated the fact that they're made from healthy ingredients.  They are sweetened naturally, and the sweet taste is not overwhelming at all -- which is a pet peeve of mine with other products.  I liked the taste of all of it -- the dough, the fruit, and the nuts.  Very yummy!\", u\"Upon opening the package I was really disappointed.  It really looked terrible... so I was hoping the taste would be better.  Well, I was disappointed there too.  Cherry and Cashew DON'T seem to go together well at all!  The texture was terrible!  I guess if you are a health bar person... perhaps this would be a nice alternative to your typical bar.  But since I'm not a health bar person, it REALLY, really grated against me.\", u'I tried one Cherry Cashew Raw Fruit & Nut bar.  Here are my impressions.  At first, did not like the taste.  However, the taste was not so bad by the time I was finished.  The bar certified organic by Quality Assurance International(QAI), which is a reputable company.  Nutritional information states 8 grams of fat per serving and 7 grams of protein with only 5mg of sodium.  Obviously not a protein bar by any measure. My surprise was that the bar only contains 3 grams of fiber.  I suggest you read the nutritional information carefully before buying.  As many of my friends told me, the bar essentially serves no purpose other than a snack.The rough part (pun intended) of consuming this bar is that I almost broke a tooth.  The package indicates \"May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.\"  They were not kidding. At my 2nd bite, I though I was chewing on a small rock and actually checked the entire bar for metal or some similar material.  Turns out I chewed on a nut shell and very hard cherry stem at one point.They meant it when they named the bar \"Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.\"  Chew carefully.  Note however, that my observation is not necessarily negative in this regard.  Many organic foods present similar conditions.', u\"I really like this bar. It tastes VERY nutty, but it also is very soft, and extremely easy to chew.I love that it's VEGAN so I don't have to worry about whether or not I'm eating skin, bones, cow stomaches etc while enjoying this Blueberry bar of delicious :)Seriously, if you're looking for an awesome snack, I really think this is a great choice :)\", u\"We bought the variety pack so I got to try each flavor.  My favorite by far was the orange cranberry, but I also liked the apple cinnamon, chocolate brownie, and trail mix.  I wasn't crazy for the cherry or blueberry but they're not really my favorite fruits to begin with.  Each of the bars have a similar texture, it is really only the flavor that changes.  Some people say that the texture takes some getting used to but I didn't find it strange at all, actually a nice change from granola bars.  The one thing I would warn about is that each bar is pretty high in calories, so if you're really calorie conscious you might want to skip these and buy something that comes in a smaller portion.  The variety pack is a great way to try them all and figure out which ones your family really likes.\", u\"The Wife and I have a rule: we don't buy any power bar if it's over $1.  We like Cliff Bars anyway and if you're patient and willing to stock up when they go on sale, you can usually navigate that stricture.  A few months ago though the Raw Revolution bars, normally quite pricey, were on sale and I have to admit to liking the Chocolate Cashew and Coconut Agave ones.  They were quite tasty, though, for whatever reason, the bars are almost slimy to the touch.At any rate, we just got a Pure Bar (cherry cashew flavor) through the Amazon Vine program and while it too is slippery to the touch, the taste was even better than that of its rival.  If they're ever priced under a buck we'll be stocking up.\", u'I opened this package to find a dense, nearly black bar with nut bits in it.  As I held it up in my hand, I thought, \"Did I already eat this?\"Needless to say, a bar that reminds me of a square of bear poop didn\\'t really strike my fancy from the get go, but I was thinking maybe it would taste good even if it didn\\'t look that great.  But nope, it was bland and sour.I didn\\'t like it.  For 170 calories (if memory serves) I\\'ll just grab a granola bar.  Maybe its not perfectly organic or whatever, but I\\'ll actually want to eat it, and when it comes to FOOD that seems to be a pretty important quality.', u\"Aw. I really wanted to like this raw fruit & nut bar because a raw food bar is such a great concept. But the bar tasted mainly like old nuts and vitamins. There aren't added vitamins in the ingredients, but that's still what I tasted. The fruits (dates and cherries) make the bar medium-sweet. But I certainly wouldn't guess that this was a cherry-flavored bar. I think this might be a better bar with a different combination of FRESH nuts (maybe minus walnuts, plus macadamias to add to the almonds and cashews in it) and with better quality fruit. I would have preferred a stronger cherry taste, but I really only got a faint figgy taste from it. I imagine I'll be steering clear of this brand in the future.\", u\"I have to admit, I was ready to *not* like this bar.  I'm not a fan of any type of bar that's not chocolate :) but this was very, very good.  I was expecting sort of a fig newton looking item, but it is dark and rich in color (I've uploaded a photo).  I can taste the cherry, the cashews, and it is quite filling.  It's rather chewy, too.  The wrapper says that the bar was not cooked at all, and nothing was processed, and it lists the ingredients that could cause allergies -- which is where it kind of stunned me because among the regular items you would expect in an organic fruit and nut bar like nuts, milk, eggs -- fish is listed too! So vegans and vegetarians, be wary!The carb count is rather high at 25g, and there are 190 calories and 3g of fiber.  This is actually something I would buy and keep a little stash of in my office drawer.Recommended!\", u\"The best part about this bar is that (unlike most others) I cannot taste the dates.  They're a little sweet, but not too much so; the tartness of the cherries helps balance things out.  I take these with me for breakfast or a snack to classes, and it helps fight off any hunger while I get some protein.  I've also found that it is more filling if I drink it with something (juice or a bottle of water) and can make a quick meal.  I'm new this whole raw food thing, so these have been life-savers for when I'm tired of eating whole foods and salads.\", u'These bars are a bit small for the price and I found them to be way too chewey for my pleasure. I shared this bar with my boyfriend - both of us eat different types of food bars during the day - and neither of us would buy this again. The flavor was lacking and the texture was too dense.', u'This PURE organic cherry Cashew, Raw fruit and Nut bar gets your attention from the first bite. It is a taste you can savor and it lasts a while. Tangy, delicious and chewy in a satisfying kind of way. I highly recommend it. Enjoy !', u'Well I only got one of the bars to try, but that one bar was very good.  IT was a bit sticky however taste wise I found it very very tasty.  I would eat them as a breakfast bar with no complaints.', u'One thing I like about fruit and nut bars is the different tastes that each successive bite gives you. When one particular part of the bar has more nuts, you get the taste of nuts, and when there is more fruit in a particular bite you get a taste of fruit. This results in not just variety of taste but also variety of texture. Although these organic cherry cashew, raw fruit and nut bars are clearly composed of several different types of food, they are mixed together in the final product so that the taste and texture is pretty uniform. That said, I did not particularly mind the taste or texture themselves. The bars are definitely not too sweet and the texture of the bar, somewhat chewy, is pretty good. Still, in the end, I cannot honestly say that, if given my pick of fruit and nut bars, that I would pick this product over any number of other snack bars I have tasted in the past.', u\"I really love the Banana  coconut walnut the best as to me they are soft, moist and taste a great deal like banana bread that is not dry of course AND a good banana taste... just perfect.. and then the chocolate ones.  On the chocolate ones to me the chocolate was not very strong -reminded me of a brownie but not a candy type -more of a energy bar cake type BUT still good. So So on the blueberry one but again I am not that much of a blueberry fan.  I have since ordered full cases of the banana coconut walnut ones and will probably order a case of the cherry chocolate.I bought the variety pack with finding out if I liked them vs someone elses taste buds.I'm a Grandma so this is my opinion and my age group. I hope this helps you decide.\", u'I\\'ll be the first to admit - I\\'m not well versed in the raw food movement. But, I do know a good thing when I taste it. And, I also happen to believe that the fewer artificial ingredients or excess (non-natural) sugars, the better.Being a \"Cherry Cashew\" flavor, I honestly expected a bit more cherry flavor to this bar. But, on first taste, it reminded me of a fruitcake - a nicely textured mixture of fruits (dates, cherries) and nuts. This definitely isn\\'t your aunt\\'s stale, hard fruitcake that is so often maligned around the holidays.These bars aren\\'t cheap, and they\\'re definitely not low calorie (190 calories per 48 gram bar). But given the all-natural form of these sugars, I\\'d think they\\'re a much better snack nutritionally than even \"low calorie\" options.', u'Amazing!  How did they put so many calories, almost 200, in such a small bar?  This bar is a perfect snack to take hiking or skiing.  With all those calories, it is not exactly a lunch dessert bar.The ingredients are all natural organic nuts and fruit. They come inCherry Cashew,Wild Blueberry,Cranberry Orange, and aVariety Pack.  The nuts are embedded in a fruit matrix.  There is no added sugar, although the taste is sweet.  So these are very much fruit bars, with nuts to give them texture.  I was pleasantly surprised by the good taste of these energy bars.', u\"No refined sugar, no gluten, dairy or soy, no cholesterol, trans fats, preservatives or anything artificial, sounded great to me but....I tried this PURE organic cherry cashew bar from Amazon and all I can taste is the overwhelming rancid nuts. I have to rate this item based on my experience, so sadly I can only give it one star. Not much else I can say based on what I tried other then all the ingredients listed are good simple and organic. Problem with all these natural foods which contain nuts especially raw nuts is that they are extremely volatile and have 0 shelf life because there are no preservatives. Too bad something with the best of intentions can't make it to the public to enjoy before going bad. These bars sound really good and probably are if you are lucky enough to get one that hasn't spoiled, I haven't been that lucky.\", u'I love organic products and love these bars for the merit of their ingredients, but I\\'m not a super huge fan of the taste. They\\'re a bit chalky and sort of dry.It\\'s not too bad, but I think I\\'d eat these for the nutritional value and \"pure\" ingredients more than I would for their flavor.', u'It is great to have an all-natural bar without refined sugars.  It is good to get kids to try something that might not make them hyper and yet still get credit for giving a treat.  Whether they want a second one...well, I guess that depends on the children.  Ours did not.  We prefer the Luna bars.', u'[See our photo upload of this treat.]Although small portioned, the \"Pure Bar\" Organic Wild Blueberry is fresh, noticeably raw, and ever so tasty.The bar is moist, nuts relatively soft, and the fruit is real and chewy, with sweetness that tastes natural without added sugars. The portion size is rather small (again, see the picture), but in comparison to other bars on the market, we really enjoyed this one by far.', u\"I found these on amazon, and decided to try them.  They are all delicious, organic, all natural, no sugar!!!  Delightful treats!!  The flavors are great.  I often slice them thin, or in cubes, just to have a sweet treat, with a sliced apple or other fruit.  They are great any time of day, and I don't feel guilty (except for the plastic wrapper) for eating them..  calories not too high, and they are so good!  I have gotten a box a month on subscribe and save - and they are great to have around, to keep me from buying chocolate bars, or cookies!!\", u'The texture of this bar is different from many others; it is chewy like fruit, not like something baked or held together with marshmallow-stuff.  It made sense when I noticed that dates are the main ingredient.  Tastes good and healthy.  Nice with a cold drink of water!', u\"Though I am not a big fan of energy bar, I am impressed with the taste of it. It is actually moist, has great texture, and not overly sweet at all. I then checked the nutrition contents. It doesn't have refined sugar, cholesterol, or trans fat. I can actually test the fruit bits in it. It has a mild taste of fruits and a lot of fiber. It is a good alternative for a quick breakfast when you are on the go. You can use it to simply refresh your energy in exercises.\", u'I\\'ve enjoyed other varieties of Pure Organics bars, and this wild blueberry & nut bar is no exception. Taste is good, fruits and nuts are well-balanced and sweet without being too sugary. They seem to keep me from getting hungry like some other less expensive bars do (Nature Valley granola, Neutra-grain, etc). I always check the price between Powerbars and these, and purchase whichever is cheapest, both fill the same need - flavorful, filling, and healthy alternative to a \"real meal\".', u\"This is my type of 'snack' bar. It has the consistency of marzipan with a rich blueberry flavor. The walnuts, cashews, and almonds are finely ground, and the sweetness is all natural, from the juices.... not from sugar or corn syrup. I compared the nutritional value to a Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bar, and they are similar regarding carbs. The Pure bar is slightly heavier in weight and has 190 calories vs the 140 Nature Valley Bar. It also has almost twice the fat, but that is from the nuts and oils. The Nature Valley has almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds, and crisp rice. Pure has no rice, and all ingredients are organic. It also is gluten-free. I'm putting in my order for these bars, because they have a higher protein content (6 gms) than Nature Valley (3 gms), and protein is what I need to keep my blood sugar at a reasonable level. Great product....worth a try.\", u\"As my reviews for Cliff and Kashi products show, I like natural/organic food products.  So I was excited to try the new Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar.  This is the kind of thing that I eat for a snack on a regular basis, and I'm always looking for new things to mix into my rotation.  Unfortunately, this product will not be one of the ones that I add.I'm not going to address the nutrition aspects because at a basic level you have to like a product first.  I had a couple of issues with the blueberry bar that I tried.  First, the nuts in the bar are soggy and as such not as crisp as I prefer.  I like the crunch that the almonds in Kashi's TLC Honey Almond Flax bars have much better than what the Pure bar had.  Second, the overall texture seemed very gritty and muddy (I don't like pinto beans for similar reasons).  I thought the blueberry flavor was OK, but it was not enough to overcome the other issues that I mentioned.So, there's still a chance that you might like these wild blueberry bars.  However, if your tastes are like mine, you're going to want to pass.  If you have a specific question that I did not address, please feel free to post it as a comment, and I will try to answer in a timely manner.\", u'The Pure Organic Raw Fruit and Nut Bar is a healthy alternative for snacking and provides 6g of protein and 3g of fiber. The ingredients include organic dates, almonds, cashews, walnuts, and blueberries. The flavor is quite intense and surprising. They are very sweet but contain no refined sugars. This is also a gluten-free product. My first impression after biting into you reminded me of a fig newton. It has the same type consistency and flavor. I found the fruit flavor more notable than the nuts. Nice product!', u\"The first experience opening the package was that the bar didn't have the most pleasant smell.  Not bad, just not enticing.  The taste is pretty good as far as this type of product goes ... large pieces of cashew that had a good taste to them. The bar is dense and moist, making for a satisfying eating experience.  But I could get no taste of cherry at all.  I hoped, since this was raw fruit, to taste much more cherry. Overall, a pretty good product, but didn't stand out as being superior in any way to the dozens of other products of the same type.\", u'No doubt about it -- I was sorry that Amazon\\'s Vine program sent me only one bar -- I wanted a whole box!  This Pure bar is delicious.  And, since I\\'ve been avoiding gluten, this gluten-free bar is right up my alley.  Plenty of dates, plenty of nuts -- just the thing for a quick snack.So why do I give it only four stars?  It\\'s the label.  It\\'s called a \"cherry cashew\" bar, but cherry is not the predominant ingredient either by weight or by volume.  According to government regulations ( \"Ingredients required to be declared on the label or labeling of a food, including foods that comply with standards of identity, except those ingredients exempted by 101.100, shall be listed by common or usual name in descending order of predominance by weight(\"Ingredients required to be declared on the label or labeling of a food, including foods that comply with standards of identity, except those ingredients exempted by 101.100, shall be listed by common or usual name in descending order of predominance by weight . . .\"), it should be called a \"date cashew bar with a hint of cherry.Now I\\'ll still enjoy my next Pure bar, even if it is mislabeled, but since the label does not list ingredients in order of weight as required, I could not give it five stars.', u'This product should be sent back to the design team. Why?- Organic but tasteless- It should focus on one main ingredient, instead of mixing all kind of things- The nuts are too mushy, not crispy anymoreThe only positive thing is that it is not infused with sugar. The fruit juice sweetens it.Fix this product and let me review again.', u'My previous experience with this kind of bar has not been positive.  They tend to be dry, chewy, very crunchy, etc.  This one very obviously contained a lot of fruit; it was moist and chewy (in a good way).  There was a strong flavor of the cherry, and almost no cashew taste, just the crunch.  It is, because of the fruit content, high in sugar but the protein was higher than I expected.  I thought this was very good.', u'Allow me to give you some frame of reference on me: I\\'m not a vegan or even vegetarian, or sufferer of Celiac Disease. If I fell into either one of those camps, I would instantly raise the rating at least a star. But since I\\'m not adverse to occasionally ingesting an artificial ingredient or two, I\\'ll give you the straight dope on this very healthy snack bar.The ingredient list is quite impressive, if only for the fact that someone who doesn\\'t have a chemistry degree can understand it. That in itself is refreshing. They\\'ve even got a YES/NO breakdown printed next to the ingredients that goes something like this:YES!: Certified Organic, Gluten-Free, Full Serving [of] Fruit, Organic Protein, Rich in Omega-3s, Good Source of Fiber, Raw, VeganNO!: Refined Sugars, Gluten Dairy or Soy, Cholesterol, Trans Fats, Preservatives, GMOs, Artificial Nothin\\'WOW! 5-STARS SO FAR! Let\\'s tear this thing open!At first glance, it looks just like holiday fruitcake that\\'s been mashed with a rolling pin. Mmmmm... Maybe that\\'s why it doesn\\'t need preservatives and the expiration date is almost a full year in the future. Smells a lot like fruitcake, too. I lost my first test subject (my wife) on looks and smell alone. (Minus 1 star for lack of family appeal -- I don\\'t count the kids\\' outright rejection.)The first bite redeemed the bar. It\\'s tastier than I\\'d anticipated, full flavored and sweet without being powdery or sugary. I think I might like this.Though the PURE BAR is EVERYTHING they promise (pits and all - I found a tooth-crunching pit in my Cherry-flavored bar - the wrapper states, \"May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.\")I will recommend this bar to anyone who needs a Gluten-free diet, because it tastes significantly better than most Gluten-free snacks I\\'ve sampled.', u\"I give the Pure blueberry bar points for not having a gamey soy taste, but they put in too much agave nectar, and that plus the dates overwhelms the blueberry flavor.  I preferred the cherry cashew bar which wasn't as sweet.  I needed a big glass of water to wash this down.\", u\"These are a pretty standard fruit and nut bar, mainly fruit.  They have a slightly musty undertone.  However, in a field of less-than-edible gluten-free energy bars, these hit squarely in the middle of the pack.They're o.k.And, 24 hours later, speaking as a canary-in-the-coalmine hypersensitive-to-gluten celiac, I'm here to tell you that these are actually gluten-free.  They didn't make me sick.  So, if you're gluten-free, this is another thing you can eat.Nice job.\", u\"These bars are so indulgent that it's hard to have only one as a snack. They're so moist and delicious that you almost have a hard time believing they're good for you. Awesome.\", u\"As with any type of bar, I consider this a snack, not a meal replacement.  As such, it's better than most others I've tried.It's chewy, not mushy, but not overly chewy.  (Some bars seem almost like jerky, they're so tough.  This one is not like that.)  It's sweet enough, but not too sweet.  I noticed no weird aftertaste.  Because of the raw ingredients, you get not only vitamins and minerals, but enzymes, as well.All in all, this seems to be a great item to toss in the diaper bag, car, or backpack to have around when hunger strikes and there's no real food to be had.\", u'My whole family tried these adn the pure bar cherry bars at the same time. You can see my review for the cherry ones on that page, but I wasn\\'t overly impressed with them. These, however, were quite a bit better. My whole family liked the blueberry ones, but even my 4 year old with a sweet tooth wasn\\'t wild about the cherry bars.PROS:Nice texture. One reviewer said they were like a newton bar. I think that\\'s pretty close.Great fruit flavor. The blueberry is pronounced, but subtle.Great nutrition profile.Subtle nut flavor, not overpowering.CONS:Still a little \"flat\" in the flavor department. I think a little salt would be a good thing.Still just slightly chalky after taste.Overall, these were good, but still had room for improvement, however, I would consider keeping them in my purse for a healthy snack now and then. I could recommend them.', u'My husband is a big fan of Larabars, always has them on hand, and he said this tasted even better than a Larabar.  Both are raw food but the Pure bar has the added benefit of all organic ingredients that are clearly marked as non-GMO.  Myself, I don\\'t really like Larabars as I think they are too tart, so the milder and sweeter taste of the Pure bar was a plus.  The nuts as well as the blueberries were both distinct flavors, and the bar was sweet, although the sugar content is about the same as a Larabar.If you are just looking for something in the general \"granola bar\" category, there are a lot to choose from.  However, if you want ingredients that are raw, vegan (though produced in a facility that processes milk & egg), organic, and non-GMO, there are only a few to choose from.  Of course, neither Pure or Larabar have any high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils.This product runs about $1.50 to $1.70 per bar, which is comparable to the other similar items on the market.  The taste is great, and I plan to buy these on a regular basis now that I tasted one.', u\"This Wild Blueberry Bar with dates is nutritious and the taste of blueberry is very delicious. It is crunchy and fruity, but the sweetness of dates and crunchiness of cashews go very well together. I can not say you won't be hungry after eating one bar, because I felt like having another. Some reviewers have said that this is very sweet but I think this is just about right. If you like date and nut combination in snack bar then this is your brand.\", u\"Has a pretty mild taste, so I found myself just eating it without really enjoying it. It has a bit of a foul smell, but that didn't bother me to much, as the smell didn't translate into a bad taste.  There are quite a few calories in this bar, so I think I would prefer to eat something with fewer calories.  However, there is lots of protein, omega 3 acids, and vitamins, so you are getting a healthy snack out of it.  I probably wouldn't find myself buying this product again.\", u'I really enjoyed the Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, as did my 4 year old daughter. It was not too sweet, tasted like real fruit and not artificially flavored berries and was satisfying as a snack in between meals. It is good enough to have as a dessert or treat. I love that these bars are grain and soy free-- 2 ingredients that I am increasingly avoiding as I am becoming aware of their negative effects. I also preferred this brand over the Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, which are tasty, but I somehow find a bit too oily. I would definitely recommend these bars, especially for anyone following a Paleo or Primal type diet. Yumm!', u'I\\'ll be the first to admit that neither my husband nor I are what you\\'d call health freaks. Yes, we like to eat healthy food, but we don\\'t have a problem with eating some non-healthy foods either. And we can both be a bit skeptical when it comes to \"organic\", because we\\'ve had many different organic things that were disappointing, to say the least.This bar, however, wasn\\'t horrible at all! It tasted quite a bit like a nutty blueberry muffin, which is always pleasant to taste! The texture was good - not too hard, not too soft. We\\'ve eaten some bars that were far too hard to eat and made you think you were going to break your tooth on them! This bar, however, was nice and moist (which my husband particularly enjoyed).And we were both in shock to find that there was absolutely no sodium in this bar - astounding!For a health food bar, we both consider it to be absolutely wonderful. The only reason we gave it 4 stars is because my husband wished that it would have had a bit more taste to it - he likes strong, bold flavors, and this was more of a muted, sweet flavor. I, however, thought that the flavor was perfect. The thing that we both agreed upon was that we would definitely eat more of these, and will be looking into other flavors for our children (they don\\'t care for nuts) - they\\'d be a great snack for them, and for us as well!', u\"The Pure Organic Wild Blueberry raw fruit & nut bar ~ it was kind of strange...it tasted ok, but I found myself wishing for more blueberry flavor.  There was a soggy feel, weird texture and an unappetizing look ~ I would likely only buy one if I was really hungry & there was no better choice...I would say with 26g carbs, 19g sugars and 8g of total fat, it is a reasonably healthy bar: but I don't think I would personally use this as a snack or meal replacement...I just wasn't really a big fan: it was ok, but not great...this is just my opinion, maybe healthy people than I will really enjoy them?\", u'I shared my \"Pure Bar Organic Wild Berry Fruit & Nut Bar\" with my wife.  Her first comment was \"Mmmmm\" and her second was \"Tasty\".  Indeed it was (we both love blueberries).  I found the bar very moist with a nutty crunch to it.  As I continued eating the bare my wife insisted that she get another bite.  A few days later she wanted to know the name of the bar because she was hungry and wanted to buy some.  Unfortunately, new products don\\'t get to our town all that quickly.I rated this bar \"***\" because there are so many foods that I consider better than this fruit bar.  However, I have never before eated a \"natural health food bar\" that I enjoyed.  I enjoyed the \"Pure Bar Organic Wild Berry Fruit & Nut Bar\".', u\"While I give credit for the Pure Bar being as it says- All natural- I just can't get into them. It tastes kind of like a blueberry wheat-biscuit breakfast cereal that has been blended into paste and formed into a bar. It's not bad tasting, but it's nothing I'd ever crave, either. It's probably very good for my body, but then, so is just eating a bowl of blueberries and cashews, and the bowl of fruit and nuts would be much tastier than this.There's not much to expand on, here. It's pretty much what you'd expect from this type of gluten-free, organic, all-natural snack bar. It does little to shake the preconception of it being rabbit food, and despite being healthy, it does nothing to make me forget my craving for a bacon cheeseburger and a bag of chocolate-covered raisins. In short, this is the kind of snack that reminds me why I would never embrace a gluten-free or vegan diet unless my life depended on it.If you do happen to be a vegan, or need gluten-free snacks, or just need to keep a full serving of fruit in your pocket for travel, this is a good choice for you. I endorse it as one of the better bars of its kind. They get four stars for selling a product that tastes OK, is just as natural as they advertised, and seems to be affordable considering the contents.My advice: Definitely buy it if you're into this kind of thing. Avoid it if you don't feel any guilt over craving a chocolate bar.\", u\"Let's start off by saying I have no credibility as a food critic.  I'm a career military officer, and in my 16 years in uniform have eaten things that should not be described (or eaten, actually).  But here we are, so I will do my best.Because I was running late again, I grabbed this off the table instead of breakfast.  I won't say that I suddently had the energy of a 19 year old, but I also wasn't dragging my tail afterwards either (translation-it was a decent breakfast).Considering there isn't anything in here (no soy, no glutens, no preservatives, no trans-fats) it actually tastes pretty decent.  I was also surprised at the texture, which was much more like a thick fruit roll-up and not at all like the wood or cardboard I was expecting.  While I don't get into the power bar craze, I do like granola bars, and this seems to be a decent substitute.So a regular guy with no credibility in this area at all thinks this thing is decent.  Take it for what it's worth.\", u'Four HEALTHY Stars!  A good-tasting all-natural 1.7 ounce fruit & nut bar loaded with organic dates, organic cashews, organic walnuts, organic rice protein concentrate, organic wild blueberries, (with organic sunflower oil, organic apple and lemon juice concentrates), etc, and nothing is cooked or processed. The combination of all of these flavors works very well, without the uncooked aspect becoming a taste or chewing issue. The bar is smaller than the normal candy bar, but packs 190 calories, 8 grams of fat, 0.5 grams of saturated fat, 19 grams of natural fruit sugars, 26 grams of carbohydrates, 6 grams of protein, and 3 grams of fiber. This bar gives a good, all-natural energy jolt when a snack is in order at home or the office, without the empty calories of chips and candy. Definitely Recommended. Four ORGANIC Stars!!', u'After finishing off this bar for the first time, I immediately wanted another one. I cannot say that about many bars of this type that usually have some \"off-flavor\" in there making the fruit indistinguishable. No so with this one. The cherries were obvious as well as the cashews. The Pure bar also seemed to have more substance than the usual \"goo\" of similar bars. I have only tired this flavor so far, but the Pure bar is clearly the best in it\\'s field. I can highly recommend this one.', u'On the package it states what other types of food items are processed in the same facility. If I was vegan, it would worry me that this raw fruit and nut bar was made in a place where they process fish.The taste was nothing to write home about, it tasted like a badly artifically flavored blueberry muffin and the texture was not very enjoyable. I guess if I was starving I might be able to eat the whole bar, but I was able to eat less than half of it and kept trying to give the rest to my son.I think the product page needs to be updated to reflect what other food items are processed in the facility, I misplaced the package, but if I remember correctly they included: milk, soy, peanuts, and fish. I think buyers should be able to know what else is processed there, so they can make an informed decision before buying this product', u\"I usually think of health food bars as equivalent to chewing on cardboard. Pure's bar, however, is tasty, crunchy, and has an interesting texture. At 192 calories, it's not exactly healthy, but that's true for any of the competition that have any taste.\", u'I have been looking for a bar that tastes good and is low in sugar.  Since there wasn\\'t supposed to be refined sugar in these, I thought it might work.  All of them have 16g of sugar, except the dark chocolate berry bar, which has 17g.  Looking at the ingredients, just about everything provides some sugar, even if it isn\\'t refined sugar.  Lots of fruit, which I expected, but is agave nectar really needed as an ingredient for all of them?  Some have it for the second ingredient.  After a quick internet search, I found this statement, with lots of information to back it up: \"Agave nectar is bad for you. It\\'s not traditional, not natural, highly refined, and contains more concentrated fructose than high fructose corn syrup.\"  The bars all have 190 or 200 calories, and 1.7oz in weight.  Lots of calories for little volume.  They all have 6g of protein.  I\\'m going to keep looking.', u\"I love this bar!  It's one of my favorites, and eating it is like having a special treat.  When I first tried it, I was disappointed that it wasn't sweeter.  It didn't have the big brownie taste I was expecting.  But then I realized it's a snack bar, not a brownie, and I came to love the slightly subdued flavor.  The bits of walnut are perfect and add a little crunch to the smooth texture of the bar.  I would highly recommend this product.  The lack of overpowering sweetness is probably what lets it be a snack bar instead of a real brownie.\", u'The product didn\\'t taste like your typical brownie, but then again, it is a much healthier alternative to \"junk food\" brownies. I find the Pure Bar brownie to be an excellent alternative to the junk food variety. With the first batch I got, the texture was rather dense and chewy, as opposed to cake-like. However, the second batch must have been a little fresher, because they weren\\'t quite as chewy. Wholesome ingredients and being a healthy alternative to typical junk food are what make Pure Chocolate Brownie Bars a four star product. This is more like a health food brownie. I won\\'t give up Betty Crocker brownies entirely, but the Pure Bars will become a standard item in my pantry.', u\"I've always been a fan of snack bars as a quick source of energy before or after workouts.  Lately, I've been more conscientious about simple and natural ingredients, which is why I always bought Lara bars to satiate my energy fix.  However, these blueberry Pure bars are fantastic!  Most of the bulk comes from a variety of nuts and the sweetness comes from nectar and apple juice concentrate.  Nutritionally, the Pure bar has almost 200 calories, 8 grams of fat, and 6 grams of protein.I'll probably stick with Lara bars since the sweetness comes from dates and nothing else.  But it is nice to have options. This is gluten/soy/dairy free and is vegan in case anyone was wondering about this info.\", u\"I like my wholegrain organic bars as much as the next guy, but this bar, and the other one did not impress me. Organic is bandied about,but it does not always mean tastes good. I prefer fiber one bars, nutrigrain bars, and even planter's peanut bars over this. Low on flavor, low on texture, and at the end of the day do we really need another bar? I hope they find traction, but I was underwhelmed.\", u\"I've been snacking on Kashi TLC Cherry Dark Chocolate granola bars for years and recently decided that I needed to branch out and try a different brand. The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew is one of the better snack bars that I've tried. It has a pleasantly tart taste from the cherries similar to the Kashi bar. The texture is completely different obviously since this is a fruit and nut bar. The bar is substantial enough to be a filling in-between meal snack.This bar is attractive because of it's natural ingredients. No ingredients like HFCS or preservatives in this bar. Vegetarian and vegan friendly. I'll definitely be buying more of these bars and trying a few different flavors as well.\", u'I\\'m a huge fan of bars. Granola bars, fruit bars, energy bars... I like the portability factor and ease of just popping a package open and getting my nosh on. As a busy mom who needs stuff like this to carry with me while I\\'m out to keep my calories coming (yay breastfeeding!) I\\'ve been fond of Luna Bars (Luna - Chocolate Peppermint Bar 15x1.69 OZ for a while now. But they don\\'t really have a fruity option I like. So I decided to try out these Pure Bars.Firstly, I\\'m not much of a health nut though I try to be health concious to a point. These bars are certified organic, gluten-free, contain no refined sugars, dairy or soy, preservatives or trans fats, they\\'re packed with Omega-3s and fiber and they are vegan. The fat content is a little high (I\\'m suffering with gallbladder disease and fats are not our friend) for something I would consider a snack in that long stretch between lunch and dinner but they\\'re the healthy fats found in nuts.But what about the taste? I\\'m surprised to be honest. Most \"health bars\" have a chalky taste that may not appear at first but becomes an after taste when you\\'ve finished. Since these are made with raw fruit and nuts, a little rice protein and sweetened with agave nectar they taste amazing! I\\'m not sure about any of the other flavors but if you like nuts and cherries the Cherry Cashew one is so gooood. :D The texture of the fruit is smooth, almost creamy and the nuts add just a little crunch.I think the price is a little too steep for these to become my regular diaper bag snack staple but considering they\\'re organic and mostly fruit and nuts they\\'re not really that expensive. I\\'ll definitely recommend them to some of my other mommy pals (especially nursing moms who need healthy but calorie rich options) and the family vegan.', u\"Nice citric snappy flavor. Filled me up even though there wasn't much more than two bites. A great snack for after chemo, to supplement meals, or just give you a boost in the middle of the day. The only complaint I related to gumminess. Serious gumminess going on where there should be *some* crunch. Granola bars have that slight, bumpy texture and just a bit of crunchiness. This has neither. BUT the blueberry goodness does make up for most of what the texture lacks.\", u'Yum!!!  Unlike the popular yet brick-like LaraBars which are also made of raw fruits and nuts, PURE ORGANIC Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are a much lighter and more enjoyable choice if you\\'re in search of a healthy alternative to the usual (and chemical and sugar loaded) \"protein\" and \"health\" bars out there.The Wild Blueberry bar is sweet and chewy and you can really taste the blueberries....and it tastes like REAL blueberries, not the Pop Tart phony \"blueberry flavor.\"  The almonds and cashews in this bar aren\\'t as noticeable as they are in the other bars that feature them but they make the blueberry bar very tasty and chewy.I really loved the Cherry Cashew bar mostly because I have a propensity for things that are tart. The cherries are so delicious and are a perfect compliment to the cashews that you get in every single bite. Just sweet enough but also surprisingly tart - a perfect balance of both flavors.The great thing about these completely pure and raw snack bars is that you actually feel satisfied after you\\'ve eaten one and it fulfills any craving you might have for something sweet.  At 190 calories per bar, you\\'re getting a really healthy \"sweet fix\" with all of the benefits of pure protein, fiber, and a lot of important extra vitamins that you certainly wouldn\\'t get by indulging your sweet tooth with a pre-fab candy bar or one of the completely unhealthy \"protein\" bars that are laden with harmful ingredients most people can\\'t even pronounce.Pure Organic Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are my new favorite snack!!', u\"This review is based on a sample provided through the Amazon Vine program.I like blueberries.  This bar has real blueberries in it, and tastes like it.  How can you go wrong?  Well, you can't really.  They're good, but you do need to remember that they are snack bars.  They are pretty small.\", u\"Coincidentally, I watched a PBS show last night that talked about the way our food is processed today, so I've committed myself to buying and eating more organic foods, which this bar is. For that reason, I gave it four stars instead of three. Taste wise it was okay, but I tasted more dates than blueberries. The consistency is sort of pasty, but it did have a nice (date) flavor, rather than the bland, soy taste. The bar is vitamin enriched, although it's not overloaded. The price per bar if bought using Amazon's Subscribe and Save option is very competitive at less than $1.50/bar. My guess is that the stores will charge closer to $2 each for these. If you see it on the shelf at you local store, try just one before you spring for an entire box of 12.\", u\"The blueberry flavor was very subtle. I have never had a raw bar before, but I have eaten raw foods. As you would expect it does have a crunchy/chewy texture because of the fruit and nuts. Overall, what I like most is the light snack feeling that you don't get from other heavy bars. Easy enough to digest, would definitely put a few in the grocery cart next time I'm out shopping. Because of their soft texture, definitely don't want to leave this in a warm place as it might become gooey.\", u'I had high hopes for this treat.  It sure sounded yummy based on the description.  HOWEVER, it was like the insides of a fig newton, but only after being left out on the counter for a couple of years.  It had an unpalatable appearance, didn\\'t smell very good,and didn\\'t really taste much of cherry or cashew.  It\\'s fairly high in fat.  I\\'m not very adept at describing flavors, but truly this had a kind of vague fruity taste that was at best non-descript.  I had originally split my bar with my wife, but she took one small bite and set it aside.  \"Maybe you\\'ll like it,\" she said tentatively.  I did not.I will never try another product from this company.', u'Not a bad little bar, and I had no problems with the taste of it (though I\\'m not terribly fond of blueberries; thanks for not offering me cherry till the second go-round, Vine!), but the texture made me think twice about buying these. I know this is an individual thing, and your mileage may (and probably will) vary, but the almost gluey texture was very difficult to chew and the \"mouth feel\" (forgive me, I will never use that awful term again) had more in common with Elmer\\'s glue than it did food. I\\'m giving it the gentleman\\'s C.', u'As a person who is more involved with health and nutrition than the average person that has also purchased raw food bars before, I was happy that this was offered though the Amazon Vine program and I glady ordered the sample.  It tastes good and it claims to contain \"nothing cooked, nothing processed,\" but that is not the simple truth.  The bar contains \"agave nectar\" which does not occur naturally.  It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.  It is derived from processing and cooking the core of the blue agave plant for many hours in order to break down its starches into sugars.  Agave nectar was originally touted as a \"healthy alternative\" to table sugar, but it is potentially much worse than table sugar on your body.  It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.  First of all, I don\\'t understand why they thought they needed to sweeten this \"raw\" bar, and second, they used \"agave nectar\" which sounds good to the uninformed, but it is not a raw ingredient and it has a very high fructose content.  I think they used \"agave nectar\" to hide the additional fructose (or sugar) on the label.  There is controversy, but fructose and particularly agave nectar may be bad for you.You can research for yourself, google \"agave nectar bad\"and look for entries from \"foodrenegade,\" \"nourishedkitchen\" and \"living-foods\"You can also google \"fructose bad\"check out the hits from \"about\" and \"the american journal of clinical nutrition\"Fructose and in particular, High Fructose Corn Syrup are the subjects of much controversy today.  There are studies that conclude that there is no appreciable difference between sucrose and fructose to our bodies (and of course, fructose is a component of sucrose).  There are also studies that indicate fructose may be problematic.  Regardless of which camp you\\'re in, \"agave nectar\" is a hidden source of fructose in this bar and it is not raw.  The fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims \"nothing cooked and nothing processed\" is nothing short of fraud.', u\"Like a lot of similar bars, a heavy taste, very solid and natural.  I prefer granola bars but this was a decent change of pace.  And I'm partial to cashews.  A better-than-most entree in the organic snack/energy bar field.\", u\"I don't like nutrition bars but I do eat them from time to time.  Compared to other bars, this is maybe a bit less awful.  The contents were quite natural and were pretty palatable.Will I ever eat one again?  Probably not.  If someone gives me one I might, but it is certainly not something that I'm going to seek out.  But if you like nutrition bars, this is way above average.\", u\"When I received this bar, I really expected it to be mealy and weak, but what I got was an extremely pleasant bar that I will absolutely order again.The bar was moist and full of amazingly fresh and natural ingredients.  The cherry flavor was just delicious and I would have certainly eaten more if I had them.  The nuts were not stale, they tasted perfectly fresh and the fruit was really plump and sweet.One of my favorite items that I've eaten from Amazon.\", u'Very nice blueberry taste, lots of nuts in each bite. Appears to be a very healthy snack alternative. Would recommend.', u'Honestly, there was nothing wrong with the bar, but yu can get it by a few other names.  It was just not very special and seems like a \"me-too\" product.  The ingredients list was exception and all natural, but this is a crowded market and this bar did nothing to distinguish it from others.The taste of the bar was good and the texture was pleasing.  The fruit and nut combination was a good ratio.  The Pure name has a good reputation, but there are many companies trying to get the same attention and for about the same price or less.', u\"I was very satisfied with this snack bar. Unlike some of its competitors, all of its ingredients are organic and natural. There are a lot competing bars that only have some organic ingredients.As for the taste, I thought the bar was very good. It is a little on the small side, so some people might find that one isn't filling.Overall I'm happy with this product and would seek it out.\", u\"I love that this is made gluten and dairy free with natural raw ingredients.  That says a lot for a snack bar.  I wanted to like this for that reason but I just found it to be short on flavor.  I wonder if I were someone who never ate refined sugar if this would taste more flavorful to me.  The blueberry flavor was just so mild.  I make fresh juices every morning and always use fresh blueberries so perhaps I am used to that and just couldn't taste too much of the flavor in these.  I ate it over a period of about three days.  I wanted to try it at different times but my palate just never had a craving for it.  Had I really liked it, it wouldn't have made the three days I'm sure.  It has a very chewy texture and the blueberry flavor is similar to that you'd find in a muffin.  It's not bad, but there's just not enough flavor for my tastes.  If you are looking for a bar with these ingredients as a snack to get you through the day and ingredients are more important than flavor, this could be a good bar for you.\", u'Its a perfect bar nutritionally. nuts, some dried fruit, agave syrup, and nothing else. Fat contents (70 out of 190 calories are from fat) are a bit higher than I desire because of cashew nuts. Taste of dates is more predominating than cherries. Personally, I would prefer to eat the nuts and dried fruits by themselves...no need for turning them into bar, fancy packaging and environmental impact caused by the process.', u\"These are an excellent choice anytime I'm on the run. I keep them in a &#34;go-bag&#34; for those ER visits that often turn into admissions. PURE truly describes these snack bars.\", u'If you are looking for candy in your energy bar, this is not it. This is like a bar that you would make in a food processor if you had the time and all the ingredients at hand. Those who are used to an American diet of relatively high sodium and sugar will probably be underwhelmed by the taste. However, for those who like dried fruits and nuts in the convenience of a bar form, I would recommend these esp. when they are on sale. I am not a raw foodie but I tend to like many fruit based foods in a relatively natural state - i.e. straight from the tree or sun dried rather than cooked in pies or cookies. Take a look at the photos included on this page- they are very accurate. The bars are moist but not sticky; the nuts are chopped in small chunks which I like and no peanuts! (Peanuts are fine but IMO overused in many recipes). I tend to prefer almonds and walnuts but again these are more subtle flavors so this mix may not suit all- just know your own palate.', u'Totally tasteless, will not order again.  I usually share my purchases with others but not this time.  I had high hopes for this product as I try to eat healthy.  This is so below standard that it should not even be classified as a brownie.', u\"I've eaten a lot of food/energy bars in my life and up to now my favorites have been the Luna Bar and  the Larabar but this PURE bar outdoes them both. It's texture, taste, ingredients, and size are very similar to the LaraBar but the taste is just simply amazing. It has chunkier bits of nuts and fruit than the LaraBar also.This Blueberry bar is my second flavor to try (I tried the Cherry flavor first)and it is delicious! There are actual dried whole blueberries in the bar which give it a nice sweetness and very real blueberry flavor. In my experience, blueberry flavored anything can usually have a fake or chemically kind of taste but this does not at all.I highly recommend this bar!...and an extra bonus: Both my 4 and 2 year old LOVED this bar, as did my 19 yr old brother so pack these puppies as a healthy snack for your kids!\", u\"I tasted blueberries, dates, and walnuts. The texture was nice; soft with a little texture from the nuts, but not too chewy or crunchy. I was pleased to see that it supplied 1.5 servings of fruit.I thought it was very tasty and would recommend as a healthful snack food. It isn't filling enough or high enough in protein to replace a meal, but it is a nice alternative to eating junk food in between meals.\", u'The Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Raw Fruit and Nut Bar is surprisingly bland. Its ingredients include a variety of \"organic\" ingredients - several different kinds of nuts, dates, blueberries, rice protein concentrate, agave nectar, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. Nothing is cooked or processed. But for all of its positive qualities, I could only eat one bite before throwing the rest away. Unfortunately, the blueberry flavor is only minimal. It was like eating soggy, mushy mixed nuts without salt. Though it seems healthy for you, I can\\'t recommend this product based on its taste and consistency.', u'This organic bar is chewy with the occasional nut and mostly grain tasting with some hints of blueberry with every bite.  The taste is strong; this is not a bad thing or particularly a good thing as I seemed to have to take a drink a few times while easting a bar that comes in at just under two ounces.', u'Each bar is quite heavy and dense, packed with what tastes like a pure mix of dates and nuts interspersed therein.  There is a very slight cherry flavor that  primarily manifests itself as a sour after-taste.  The bar has absolutely NO \"refined sugars, gluten, dairy or soy, cholesterol, transfats, preservatives, GMOs, or artificial anything elses\".  Appearance wise, it looks like a 1 cm thick brownie with a sprinkling of nuts.  It has a higher calorie and fat count than I was expecting for an organic snack bar.Here are the primary nutrition facts for one bar (other quantities of constituents are negligible);Calories: 190, calories from fat: 70Total fat: 8 gProteins: 7 g', u'I got excited about these but upon tasting all the flavors and reading the labels, not so much. They are mostly dates and all taste the same, good at first, but you get tired of them quickly.', u'This was an organic raw bar with an all natural blueberry flavor.  I really found it tasty and bought a 12 pack after sampling this. It has a pleasant chewy/nut texture which I found quite satisfying.  It has 190 calories and contains Dates, Cashews, Walnuts, Rice Protein, Blueberries, and other yummy stuff. It contains nothing cooked and nothing processed. It is entirely raw. Enjoy', u\"You have to respect this bar's commitment.  Nothing is worse than a 'health food' that tries to taste like it's something decadent--so you get thin tasting carob instead of chocolate, etc.Not this bar. It doesn't pretend to be gooey rich and bad for you food. It is unrepentantly its own thing. And in this case, its own thing is pretty darned good.  If you've ever made a homemade granola bar, that's what this tastes like, only somehow less sticky and messy!It's delicious, what more can I say?  It doesn't pretend to be what it's not. It's a quite nice serving size, as well--perfect for a good pick me up snack!  It's sweet but not too sweet and would go well with water or a coffee beverage as a nice snack.  I can see it becoming a huge fave for hikers and other outdoors people, but the taste is rich enough that even us more sedentary folks can enjoy!\", u\"I am not one to normally eat energy bars or fruit bars. With that said, I did find this bar to be pretty tasty. The cherry and cashew combo left me satisfied. It's nice to have something like this to stow away in your car or purse for something quick to eat when you need some energy\", u\"What makes this delicious bar so moist and sweet? Dates!There is a bit of Agave nectar as well, along with other ingredients that you can actually pronounce.I opted for the variety pack, even though the combination of raspberry and chocolate is not particularly appealing. To my surprise, it was better than the much anticipated banana coconut one, which was too light on coconut.Love that I can get some raw organic fruit in my body, even on the go or off season. Glad I did 'subscribe and save'...already looking forward to the next shipment.\", u\"First off you should know this little guy is not just 1.7 oz. and 190 calories of cherries and cashews, it's actually an all-organic  mix of dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein concentrate, walnuts, agave nectar and almonds. Put 'em all together and to my tastes that adds up to a just about near-perfect midday pick-me-up....but:Would you pay $2.50 apiece for 12 of them (list price)? Or $1.73 (Amazon Prime price) or $1.47 (if you sign up for regular shipments)? I wouldn't. At least not for snacking at home or work, where I could grab a healthful handful of dried fruit and nuts for a good bit less. Then again, packing one or two of these in a pocket to nibble on at the movies or ballpark can look like a bargain compared with what something equally healthful and tasty would cost you there,  if available, which I doubt.\", u'This is an organic bar with seven ingredients: dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein, walnuts, agave nectar, and almonds. Nothing is cooked or processed. The bar is two inches by three inches, just a little snack for 190 calories. But the cherry flavor is deceiving. The main ingredient is dates. All I tasted is dates, nuts, and a hint of cherries, which I believe comes from some kind of cherry flavoring and not actual cherries themselves, which to me is a bit deceiving. Beyond that, it is a good light snack that cures the sweet tooth without all the processed sugar or many calories.Shawn KovacichMartial Artist/Krav Maga InstructorAuthor of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.', u'I got this fruit and nut bar to try and was fairly impressed. While many fruit bars that claim to be organic can taste a little bit like paper or not as tasty, I found this to be rather tasty. Both my boyfriend liked it and thought it had just the right amount of sweetness to it without it overpowering everything else.', u\"I have to say the looks of this bar was not very appealing at first opening of the package.  I decided to share this with my husband and granddaughter so that I could see how they liked it as well. I did not like this bar as well as I did the blueberry ones.  I think the first look at it kind of turned me off, however the taste wasn't as appealing to me either as the blueberry.  I can say this  is a great bar for a quick healthy snack, you know you are eating something good for you, but to me the taste left something to be desired\", u'Perfect! Not too sweet, very filling and just the right size. I am getting some for my children to snack on. It feels very natural and wholesome when you eat it, it does not have that health food bar taste. It just feels like FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!on my tongue!', u'These bars have a great texture and are of the highest quality.  Vegetarians will love the taste, which is like a puff of air.', u'We enjoyed the Cherry Cashew Fruit and nut bar. Would recommend them. We had hoped that Vine would be sending a pack of 12 as indicated in the item description. Received only one bar. It was delicious.', u\"Foolishly, I ate about a third of this bar before looking at the ingredients.  I really liked the taste--but realized too late that it contains dates... and I am mildly allergic.  I can honestly say my raccoons enjoyed the rest of the bar.  If you don't have food allergies, this is truly a great bar in terms of being low fat, high protein.  And tasty.\", u'I eat a lot of protein bars.  I\\'m always looking for one that packs high protein, low carb, great taste, organic, and gluten-free.  This one seems to cover most of those bases, though I can\\'t say that I would run right out and buy one.  The protein is low for what I need to get out of the 48gram bar and the carbs fair to high, in comparison.  The blueberry comes through wonderfully, but the heaviness of the rice protein muddies it, leaving the overall bar a bit flavorless.  That it is organic is a plus, and I notice that it specifically says on the wrapper \"Certified Organic.\"  What concerns me is that it does not say, \"Certified Gluten-free.\"  This would be of particular interest to someone with Celiac disease, especially since it does not say it is wheat-free and notes that the bars are made in a facility that processes wheat.All-in-all, if you\\'re not dealing with food allergies, the bar is OK.  You can certainly find more flavorful ones with more protein and less carbs, for less money.  The price of these is unarguably ridiculous.  If I wasn\\'t concerned about the questionable gluten-free aspect, the price alone is enough to deter me.', u\"Same review as for the cherry bars - Typically, I only like to eat whole foods and until now, Lara Bars were it for me. Until now. These are amazing - really delicious and good for you, with whole food ingredients you can recognize, and they're made in Michigan! Fruits and nuts and honey - it doesn't get better than that. My kids loved them, too, which makes me happy because they're sweet enough to satisfy an urge for a candybar but so much better for you.The blueberry taste was real because the blueberries are real! The only icky thing in this bar was canola oil, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.\", u\"I was looking forward to trying and was hoping I would love a new organic snack product but was very disappointed with the texture and size of the product.  The bar was too wet and soft for me.  It wasn't wet like a fig newton but like double the moisture content at least.  You can actually see and feel how wet this organic bar is.  The flavor was a bit bland (depending where you bit) and nothing special that I would look for again especially after being turned off by the soft consistency and high moisture content of the bar.  There were bursts of blueberry flavor within areas of the bar, some nutty texture, but am not sure (by view or mouthfeel) what else was in there.  I wasn't even sure what kinds of nuts were in the bar while I ate it.  The only way I'd know what was in there besides blueberries was by reading the label.  The bar itself looked like some kind of brownish/greyish wet clay square.Some may like it because of the natural products but I cannot see myself trying this again, even if free.\", u'Yes, it is good for you and it\\'s not \"bad\".  I was expecting a bit more cherry flavor and not quite as chewy as it was. I had my husband try it as well and he did agree with me. The cherry reminded me a bit of the cherry flavor in a Shirley Temple drink.  Too chewy for me, but I think I will try the blueberry as everyone seems to say that is the way to go!', u\"I love cherries and cashews and this organic Pure raw fruit and nut bar.  I am always looking for a bar that I can take on the go that won't MELT in my backpack from spring and summer weather.  I love that it contains raw ingredients meaning nothing is processed and is completely organic.  I was afraid the cherries would be too tart but I found the balance of the nutty cashews mellowed the cherries.  I typically don't like dates but I didn't find them overwhelming in this bar.  I think it is great and healthier alternative to many other convenience foods (bars) on the market.\", u'I wasn\\'t sure what to expect after oping the Pure Organic Cherry/Cashew Fruit & Nut Bar.  It looked really dense, sticky and a bit darker than I expected.  But even for my trepidation it tasted pretty darn good.  It certainly has the tart tang of dried cherries, but the overall taste is rather mild.  There were also plenty of nuts though I was expecting the bar to be a little more crunchy.  Also, the bar contains more fruit and nuts than described on the front including dates, almonds, and walnuts which account for most of the bar.  I saw more walnuts and almonds than cashews.Overall I was a little disappointed in the bar.  Though it tastes alright, for all it\\'s touting of organic, unprocessed ingredients it\\'s kind of heavy for what you\\'re really getting.  One bar contains 190 calories, 8g of fat, 25g of carbs (17g of which are sugar and only 3g of fiber).  Granted you\\'re getting 7g of protein, so it would certainly work as a meal replacement except that it\\'s not all that satisfying at 1.7oz.  In checking some labels in my kitchen, the Pure bar has roughly the same nutritional elements as an M&M; brand ice-cream cone, and has more twice the fat of a comparable serving ofNature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars, Fruit & Nut, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)(though the rest matches up pretty much the same.)  At almost $3 a bar these are also a bit pricey for what you\\'re getting.Also, it touts to have no processed ingredients which is misleading.  It\\'s alluding to the idea that it doesn\\'t contain ingredients that have been chemically altered or cooked, but processed foods doesn\\'t just mean hot dogs and Spam.  Processed foods also refer to those that have been chopped, refined, or changed from their state in nature, and the chopped nuts, dried fruit, and extracted organic rice protein are processed (not to mention the formation of the bars, which contrary to the packages\\' description do not \"kinda grow on trees...\")  The reason I\\'m mentioning this is that the Pure brand is using a lot of healthy buzz words to allude to the utterly healthy nature of the bars, which they are if you consider each one is almost fit to be a meal onto itself.', u\"this is very grainy and nutty, but reminds me eating fruit roll-up. It's not overly sweet, and it has a lot of tang in it. I ate it one morning for breakfast. It was not very filling for me, but it was a nice start of the day. However, I think the price is a bit high.\", u\"Not my favorite. It's a very chewy bar and I prefer the crunchy ones with texture. And there's more sugar in these than others.\", u\"Can't say that this bar is delicious; it isn't.  But it IS filling, has lots of nutritional stuff in it and your conscience won't bother you when you eat this as a snack between meals.\", u\"Looks like I was not the only one who got a bar with rancid nuts. I took two bites and could not finish it. The only thing that saved it from one star was that I could actually taste the sour cherries. It's a dense, moist bar with soggy nuts. Not sure if I would give this another chance.\", u'It was edible. Not the greatest but not bad. Healthy product. Good for you. I would recommend this to a friend.', u\"The manufacturer claims this bar is made with the most pure, untainted ingredients available.  Pure's fruits and nuts are cold processed.  The company says this means the ingredients retain more antioxidants and nutrients than than bars made with ingredients subjected to high temperatures. meaning the heating process that That much I really like.  It's the putting of all those ingredients together where this bar falls a bit short.The primary flavor of this bar is supposed to be blueberry.  However, the flavor of dates overwhelmed the blueberry.  I happen to like dates so I was ok with the flavor.  However, I expected a fresh, blueberry taste that simply was not there.  Raw, organic ingredients or not, this is still a mass produced product with a lengthy shelf life.  It is no surprise, then, convenience trumps taste.\", u\"I received a sample of the wild blueberry organic Pure bar and was very happy with the flavor.  The bar is not too sweet (and not too un-sweet!) and was loaded with chunks of nuts and blueberries!  It's soft and slightly chewy with a very slightly grainy texture - but it is more like a home made snack bar than a processed one.  The contents of the bar are great as well:  Organic Dates, Organic Wild Blueberries, (with Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Canola Oil), Organic Cashews, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Walnuts, Organic Brown Rice Protein, Organic Almonds, Organic Unsweetened Lemon Juice Concentrate, and that's all! (unless you count the 14 essential vitamins and minerals, healthy antioxidants, and healthy Omega 3 fats in every bite). Nothing cooked. Nothing processed.These bars use certified organic fruits, nuts and grains, are gluten-free, vegan, and contain a full serving of fruit.  I have tried many different types of snack and meal bars as I am always on the go or too busy to sit and eat a complete meal at lunch - these bars are great and I will probably purchase many more!After trying the bar, I went to the company website to learn more and now I feel really good about these bars and the company that manufactures them.  They are a very responsible / Eco-friendly company started by a mom who really cares about what her family eats AND they are an American company located in Holland Michigan! (I'll do anything to support the state of Michigan - where I was born and raised!)Get a coupon on their website: [...].Now - on to try the other flavors!\", u'I recently had the opportunity to try the Pure Bar Organic cherry bar and the wild blueberry bar. Both bars are similar in appearance, ingredients,and nutrition facts. Both have orgaqnic dates listed as the first ingredient, making me think that \"date\" ought to be mentioned in the names of each bar. Note that in this wild blueberry bar blueberries are listed as the fifth ingredient.I like that the Pure Bars have and organic philosophy and contain wholesome ingredients. The bar is 3\" by 1.5\", so it\\'s relatively small and calorie dense. I could easily eat two or three of these at one sitting even though the nearly 600 calories would be better chosen than those consumed in a greasy burger or salty fries.The heavy bar looks and feels like raw dough or an undercooked brownie in texture. I like the taste of the blueberry much better than that of the cherry bar though one is hard pressed to detect blueberry flavor in a bar dominated more by dates and nuts.In short, this bar satisfies with its taste and choice of wholesome ingredients. It\\'s an experience I wouldn\\'t mind repeating.', u'This is essentially a candy bar.  It is much better for you than most candy bars, and, in a pinch, can substitute for food.  I split it with my 8 year old grand daughter who thought it was okay.', u\"For those of you who love tart foods, this is for you, just as long as you also like chewy foods. This is a raw product and reminds me a lot of horse/cow grain, but with a better taste. LOL. I suspect they used pie cherries (they're the tart variety) instead of sweet cherries because the color of the cherries is bright red, which is typical of pie cherries. I ate half the bar and gave the rest to one of my grown children, who also commented that it was too tart.\", u'Yummy bars! Out of all the different types of bars out there, this is my favorite. I love the mixture of the banana and coconut. They are a delicious treat and I keep a box in my house at all times.', u'My family and live on on-the-go bars as snacks when we are traveling between sporting events over the weekend.  I am always looking for a bar that is healthy, with little additives and fillers.  We are also big on organic fruits, so that element of the bar also caught my attention.  The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew was a nice surprise.  I love cherries and cashews, so this was an appealing combination to me.  The bar itself is made up of a lot of date paste, but compared to other bars I have tried recently (the ProBar was NOT a hit), the date was NOT the overwhelming flavor, nor was the consistency too pasty.  It had a nice texture and was not overly chewy.  There was a pleasant tart cherry flavor throughout the bar, and the bar itself was not overly sweet.  There were just two things I did not like about the bar.  There seemed to be too many nuts in the bar I got, and they did not taste fresh.  They lacked any \"crunch\" and seemed a bit stale tasting.  It also seemed like within 5 bites, the bar was gone.  It would be fine for a snack, but I would never use it as a meal replacement--it leaves you wanting something else to eat when you are done with it.  Overall, a good choice for a bar if you are looking for something other than chocolate or peanut butter bars that seem to abundant in the bar market.', u\"These  tasted exactly the same as a cashew cookie lara bar, and don't have enough protein for someone who's trying to sate their hunger for very long throughout the day. make sure you have some protein with this if you want to be full for more than a few minutes.\", u'I was a bit skeptical about the \"raw food\" bar, but I\\'m glad I tried it. Since I\\'m allergic to dairy, I don\\'t eat many packaged food bars--which actually means my standards are probably a bit high, since I\\'m comparing them to \"real food,\" not generic snack bars.That said, I was actually thrilled with this, and may buy more. Both this and the blueberry flavor I tried were delicious and filling. The texture was smooth, not crunchy--considerably denser than a fig newton, but more like that than like anything else I could compare it to. I don\\'t know if the raw food, vegan, etc., labels are truly healthier than the alternatives or not, but I\\'ll vouch for this being tastier than comparable items I\\'ve tried (limited sample, though) and filling.', u\"I am a real nutrition bar addict, loving the convenience, nutrition, and even the taste of many of the bars on the market. I personally look for a bar with protein and less than 30 carbohydrates. This bar fits the bill with 7 protein grams, and 25 carbohydrates along with 3 grams of fiber. I also enjoyed the pure healthy taste of fruits and nuts, they are sweet but not overly sweet and the nuttiness blends in to the flavor nicely. It has to be the most wholesome bar on the market. The ingredients are all organic and raw ,using cashews, cherries, rice protein, walnuts, agave nectar, and almonds. That's it, nothing cooked or processed. These bars are also gluten free, rich in omega 3's, and great for variety for anyone on a raw foods only diet, they are also vegan approved. They are good for you and as pure as it gets.\", u'Unfortunately I only received 1 Organic Cherry Cashew Bar, so I shared it with my father and my friend. The reviews were mixed. I really liked the tart and tangy taste and texture. It was very cherry-licious and chewy, so it made me feel more full than I really was after all that chewing. My dad, who is 88 years old and loves everything (foodwise)thought it was \"super\", while my friend Keiko liked the way it tasted, but she didn\\'t care for the way it smelled. It reminded her of oatmeal. So, all in all we thought it was very good and we will definitely be buying more of these, especially since they are gluten free, organic and relatively inexpensive.', u\"I've tried a number of this sort of thing and Pure ranks amongst the top. There is a rich blueberry taste totally unlike all the synthetic flavoring we find in heavily processed foods these days. It's basically just fruit and nuts, but the nuts aren't chunky or crunchy. The texture is soft and slightly moist, kind of like a dense cake. Above all, it tastes really great without a lot of added sugar. The natural flavor of the blueberries really comes through.If you're looking for a great tasting, healthy snack, I would recommend trying Pure. I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but I'm sure they're equally good.\", u\"I've always avoided nutrition bars for a few reasons: 1) I hate that protein powder-taste that many of them have, as well as that rice-crispie texture that many of the other  (like Luna bars) have.  2) They tend to have so many calories and processed sugar, I might as well have a Snickers.Not so with raw fruit bars, like Pure Organics (and Larabars).  I've been a Larabar devotee for awhile now, particularly their cherry pie and gingers bars.  But I've been curious about Pure Organics and finally got a chance to try one.  I tried the cherry cashew bar because I love love love cashews.  I've got to say, it's a pretty tasty bar.  But I still like my cherry pie larabar better, because it's, well, cherry-er (the cherry pie Larabar, though, uses almonds instead of cashews).  This one's nothing to sneeze at, and I'll take it over a Luna bar anyday, but I'm probably not going to switch out of my Larabar loyalty, at least not for this flavor.Still, I highly recommend bars like Pure Organic or Larabar over other nutrition bars.  One is a single serving of fruit, they are all-natural, and though they do have sugar, it's the kind that comes with fiber, so you fill up, and you don't have the crazy blood sugar drop that you get with refined sugar.  So, definitly try one!\", u\"I wanted to try these bars as a possible supplement to my energy-boosting bar of choice (18 Rabbits). Around ten or eleven o' clock my blood sugar starts to get a little low and I start feeling drowsy (I never have been a breakfast eater) and candy bars are out of the question for a long-term solution. While these bars are okay, they are not the solution I was looking for.They taste like a combination of a Power Bar and a Fruit Roll-Up. They are dense and not particularly appetizing. I don't get a perceptible energy boost from eating them either. Those who are accustomed to a strictly organic or low-sugar diet will probably like the taste more, but for me they are just okay. I would try an individual bar before buying a case.\", u\"I expected this to taste somewhat gritty and well, like any other supplement bar I've ever tried. But this is amazing! Very soft in texture, and it's actually quite tasty. No gross aftertaste. I eat this post workout or when I'm having an afternoon snack craving. Definitely recommend!\", u\"I love nuts, and having lots of them jammed into a snack bar is a nice thing. This item is exactly that.Since it's a mix, do not expect to taste each nut separately, but it tastes well. My only complaint is that the dates (as in fruit) in it are a little bit dominant in the taste, making it slightly more sweet than I expected. Yet this is natural sugar, and can be balanced easily with a cup of water.\", u\"I have to preface this by saying I'm not a nut person. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this was going to have so many nuts in it. I just saw that it was blueberry and didn't realize it would taste more like nuts than blueberries. It's very similar to Clif Nectar bars in taste and consistency. I did like that it's all raw and has all organic ingredients. I also thought that the sweetness-level was perfect. Not too sweet and not too bland. If you like nut-heavy raw food bars, I think you'll really like this. If, like me, you prefer something less nutty, skip this one.\", u\"I actually really liked this bar.  I thought it tasted good.  I thought it was a perfect mix of blueberries and nuts.  It wasn't too sweet or too tart for me.  It wasn't too crunchy or too soft.  I have had bars that are too chewy or bars that are more like bird seed.  This one seemed like the right combination of fig newton cookie and organic goodness.  I was quite pleased with it.It has 190 calories so it is a so-so snack in terms of caloric content and snack size.  It has 6g of protein which I think is really good.  It says that it is Gluten free, soy free, and dairy free but you have to be careful b/c of the place where it is made.  I say as with all bars this is one of those things that you have to try to see if you like the way it tastes, but there is a high probability that you might or at least your kids will like it! I think it is worth the risk.\", u'PURE BAR VARIETY PACK - - - I love these bars.  I have tried a few flavors, and they are soft, easy to eat, and taste like I expected.  The blueberry tastes like blueberry, etc.  I was surprised how much I like the apple cinnamon.I cannot have most trail mixes because of allergies, so I took 3 flavors of this and cut into small pieces, and added a few choc. chips.  They are a bit sticky and could use something like coconut, or a nut flour to help keep them from sticking together.  Even so, I like these and plan to keep some on hand at all times.  I have signed up for the subscribe and save.', u'I was pleasantly surprised by how nice this bar was. Would definitely buy this one again.', u'For something labeled \"Wild Blueberry\" I can\\'t taste much blueberry.  I\\'m rather disappointed about that.  I can taste more of the dates and nuts that are the first 3 ingredients in the bar.  It\\'s not bad, really, but not what I expected from the package.  I like the crunchy texture all the nuts give to the bar...gives it a bit of variety.It\\'s a filling little bar.  I wouldn\\'t eat it for the flavor, which is pretty bland, and at $30 for a dozen bars ($23 + $7.95 shipping at the time I write this)  it\\'s pretty pricey.  Like a previous reviewer said, I\\'d rather eat a handful of actual fruits and nuts than this bar, but for a snack at least this is healthier than candy bars or potato chips.', u'I really enjoyed the flavor combinations of fruits and nuts and the taste and texture of these bars.  The variety pack was a great way to try different flavors so if you wanted to order just the favorites you could.  I was surprised and pleased to like them almost all equally.  (The chocolate one was my obvious favorite because I am a Chocoholic!)', u\"Excellent meal replacement bar.I really really really enjoyed the cherry cashew date nut bar.  I merely liked the blueberry bar.  It has no chocolate (thank god!  I've always hated granola bars and protein bars and all the rest that have a coating of awful chocolate on it) but lots of fruit and a healthy sweetness (not artificial, just good, if a little on the sweet side for my taste).  I would buy the blueberry bar again if I get tired of the cherry cashew, or to swap it out a bit, but not because I particularly like it.You *will not* be hungry until your next meal after you eat this bar.  And it's a lot healthier than most other bars out there.Note: if you do not like the taste or texture of dates, DO NOT buy this bar.Also note: I really hate most protein bars, granola bars (except quaker and nature valley), clif bars, odwalla bars, luna bars, zone bars, etc.  None of those really taste good.  This one DOES and it's good for you.  But buy the cherry cashew instead, it's a lot better.\", u'These bars are very tasty whenever you need a quick pick up treat.  They are a great source of nutrition also.  Not easy to find agood edible that is good for us as well.  Try them!', u'Although this is a chewy snack bar, I expected the included nuts to add a bit of crunch into it, but they didn\\'t; it seems the nuts themselves were chewy. The texture is also mealier than I expected; it\\'s akin to a chewy oat bar.The size of the bar itself is about 3\"x1.25\"x.25\", which makes it a bit smaller than the average snack bar, but not egregiously so. It\\'s certainly not enough to fill an empty stomach, but it might be enough to tide you over for an hour or two.If you have a sweet tooth, you\\'ll want to avoid this treat. There is a *hint* of sweetness and the tart dried cherries is the most pronounced flavor--even more so than the nuts (had I not seen the nuts in the bar, I doubt I\\'d know they were there, except the almonds), and I barely tasted the dates at all. All of that said, the bar is good, but not the greatest I\\'ve tasted.I personally can\\'t find enough value to justify forking over nearly two dollars (at the time of writing) per bar, however, it might be a sound investment if you have gluten/soy allergies or are seeking to eliminate processed sugar from your diet.And since I didn\\'t see any nutritional data listed in the description, I thought it might be helpful to list it here: Serv. Size 1 Bar; Cal. 190; Fat Cal. 70; Total Fat 8g (12% DV); Sat. Fat 0.5g (3% DV); Trans Fat 0g; Chol. 0mg; Sodium 5mg; Potassium 220mg; Total Carb. 25g; Fiber 3g; Sugars (natural fruit sugars) 17g; Protein 7g.', u\"Like other reviewers, I would have liked to taste more of the blueberries in there.  But it was nice to eat a bar that didn't taste like sugar or like it was processed to within an inch of its life.  It's a bit on the bland side at first but when you acclimate yourself to eating food without all the extra sugars and artificial flavors, it actually isn't bad at all.  It also really feels good to put something into my body that isn't going to slowly kill me.\", u\"Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Bars are very tasty.  They are surprisingly moist with a hint of blueberry and lots of nuts.  They actually reminded me of my grandma's banana bread with blueberries instead of bananas. Definitely worth a try!\", u\"These Pure Organic Bars are a wonderful alternative snack to replace the usual candy bars, cookies or chips that most people snack on as a pick me up between meals. Blueberries are the most powerful berries for keeping your veins and arteries strong. I found this out when my elderly father fell and hit his head. When I found out that even a small bump can cause several clots, I read extensively on how to make the arteries and veins way stronger, and blueberries really do the job. All the berries- strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries and cherries also contain these amazing properties, but the blueberry is the best.When I first opened the wrapper on this blueberry bar, the blueberry aroma was wonderful and strong! You can see all the wonderful blueberries and nuts inside. Even though the ingredients consist of dates, cashews, walnuts, rice concentrate, wild blueberries, apple juice, sunflower oil, nectar, almonds and lemon juice, I could only taste the blueberries and walnuts. The texture is similar to a fig bar, with nuts added. Wonderfully, there is no refined sugar (great for waistlines and diabetics), no gluten, dairy or soy, no cholesterol (great for the arteries), no sodium (great for the heart), no trans fats and no preservatives.This 3 1/4 by 1 1/2 inch bar has 190 calories, which isn't bad, considering it's composed of natural fruit and nuts and does not contain damaging refined sugar. Any food under 200 calories is easy to burn off, so this is a great snack for the waist. The benefits of the nuts and blueberries is huge with the omega 3 properties, fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Blueberries have been called the healthiest food on the planet with it's powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. They slow the aging process and reduce cell damage that can lead to cancer, not to mention they strengthen the artery walls like no other food. Any snack bar that can deliver natural blueberries with no sodium, sugar or chemicals and still taste good, like this Pure Bar, rates 5 stars with me!\", u\"I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this bar. I am not a huge fan of blueberries but the other bars mentioned some ingredients I know I typically can't stand. Some reviews talk about the texture of the nuts the subtle taste of the blueberries. The blueberries are subtle but noticeable, certainly mild enough for me. I don't hate blueberries by any stretch of the imagination, but like I said, not a huge fan and found the taste to be very pleasant.  I really enjoyed the texture. I know some didn't like that the nuts weren't especially hard or crunchy, but I found the density to be great as well as the texture without it feeling heavy in my throat or stomach. I think the price is a bit high, but aside from that, I would buy these if any local stores had them at a good price. Incidentally, no local store actually carries these.One more quick note: I am not a vegetarian or vegan or especially concerned about my food being organic. This is simply the perspective from someone who tried it for the sake of trying and was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it.\", u'I am a fan of Larabars so I was jazzed to try this Pure Organic Cherry Cashew bar.  My only complaint with Larabars is that they are not organic.  This one is!  It is also made in America, another plus for me.  It is described as a \"Agave-sweetened vegan snack made with dates, cherries, walnuts, and cashews, No preservatives, trans fats, or cholesterol; free of refined sugar, gluten, soy, and dairy.\"  It is 1.7 ounces which seems pretty standard with about 200 calories.  My hubby complained that it was really high in sugar (14g), but this is not processed sugar, it is naturally occurring sugar that your body will actually know how to handle.  A bowl of crappy kids cereal might have the same amount of sugar but their sugar is all \"added sugar.\"Taste wise it is great.  It is made of: Dates (Organic), Cherries (Organic), Walnuts (Organic), Agave Nectar (organic), Almonds, Cashews (Organic), Brown Rice Protein (Organic).  The cherry taste is really nice and I can\\'t really taste the dates. I like that it can be popped in my purse for a snack instead of being tempted by a candy bar.  I would buy this again!', u\"This is a pretty good healthy alternative to the average snack out there. It makes me feel like I'm getting my daily fiber intake. It is not bad at all. It took me longer chewing it than I would like, but that's what whole food requires.  I liked it and I would order it again if I caught it on sale.\", u'Disclaimer:  I am NOT into organic, I am NOT into diet foods, I am NOT into the new craze to be a celiac, I am NOT into raw foods- unless they taste good.  This does!This bar is tasty but not at all too sweet, the bar does not contain cane sugar (though, by the way, cane is a natural growing sugar) there are a lot of other things this bar does not contain also:  no preservatives, no gluten, no dairy, no trans fat.It has a full serving of fruit, it is rich in omega-3s, it is certified organic, and vegan.A single bar has 190 calories, 8g fat, , 3g fiber, 17g sugar, 7g protein, 5mg sodiumBut never mind all that, just enjoy it guilt free as a great snack for its tasty cashews, dates, cherries and walnuts.  It is chewy in a very satisfying way.  Great to tuck in a purse or back pack for a quick delightful snack on the go.', u\"I liked these. But I cant say they were anything out of the ordinary. Chewy and fruity. About what you'd expect from a fruit/nut bar. If you are into this it would be a good snack. I doubt if I would buy them on a regular basis.\", u'I tried the Pure Cherry Cashew Bar and found the taste to be all right.  A 1.7oz (48 gram) serving (one bar) contains 190 calories (70 calories from fat), 3 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, and 17 grams of natural fruit sugars.  It is all organic, vegan friendly, has no cholesterol or wheat, and has nothing cooked.  The bars are wrapped in what appears to be Mylar and has a shelf life of over one year.As for the taste, the bar tastes like a semi-sweet fruitcake and the taste and consistency reminded me of the cherry nut cakes that came in MREs back in the 80s and 90s but with much less calories and fat.  190 calories seems a little much to me for all organic and no added sugar but I think the bar contained the right amount of fruit and nuts to have a decent taste so it was probably a good tradeoff against the number of calories.  Warning - it does contain cashews and walnuts for those with allergies.It seems like a decent product but I found it to be nothing special.  However, it you have special dietary needs or prefer organic, the Pure Cherry Cashew Bar would probably appeal to you.', u'This is a really good snack bar. I had the blueberry/nut version, and it actually had identifiable blueberries in it that tasted like blueberries - a quality that some snack items miss.It is a moist, chewy bar, which is a nice change from all the hard, crunchy bars out there that seem to fall apart when you open them.The big plus about this bar is that it is ORGANIC. It has zero trans fats, zero cholesterol, and zero sodium - which is also a big improvement over other snack bars.This would make a great snack for middle of the morning or afternoon, or a great item to carry in backpacks or on hiking trips.', u'This bar was very flavorful, with nice size pieces of Cashew nuts.  It has the consistency of a chewy brownie and about the same color.  And the bar would be great as a breakfast addition or healthy snack.', u\"The Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Raw Fruit And Nut Bar is a great-tasting fruit and nut snack bursting with the sweet and tangy taste of wild blueberries. It's a great alternative to candy, cookies, or other junk food. You should buy this wherever you can.\", u\"I found this product to have intense fruit and nut flavors with no excessive sweetness or saltiness.  The bar has a chewy texture, and resembles sheets of dried fruit, only thicker.  It is exceptionally tasty and satisfying.  However, since sweetness and saltiness are two things that many folks like, they may find the bar too bland.  There is 0 % sodium, so the product may be enjoyed without guilt by those on salt-restricted diets.  Unlike candy bars and many health bars, the Pure bar is filling and won't have you craving food for a good while after eating one.\", u'I tried the Cherry Cashew flavor and was pleasantly surprised. I\\'m not into it for the \"pure\" food aspect. I was looking for a low calorie snack. It does have a good flavor even though after taste is a bit rough. It\\'s a good portion size and filled me up. However I have two reasons why I will not purchase this product. First, it is 200 calories per bar. In my current weight loss plan, that is far too many calories to waste on a snack. I\\'ll stick to nuts or fresh fruits/vegggies. Second, the cost is close to $2 a bar (based on pricing at the the time I wrote this.) That alone will not make it worth my while.', u'I have to say that this totally surprised me.  I tend to be leary when something says it is healthy for you because most of them taste horrible but this was actually quite good.  It seems to be a bar of purrayed fruit with some nice chucks of cashews.  I loveeeeeeee cashews.  The taste was of real fruit that is slightly sweetened, quite fresh so it was soft and not the hard as a rock type of bar that some of the others are and just right for a quick healthy snack mid afternoon to hold you over until dinner.  I found this to be a large plus in my book for a quick easy snack that I can take with me and not have to worry about getting a sugar high or packing on the pounds of normal junk food.  I think if you like smoothies that you might like this so give it a try.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.', u'Every few years there is always a new fad, ruse and/or gimmick for food.  Some of these \"marketing schemes\" are, but not limited to, food being \"light\", \"fat free\", \"100 calorie serving\", \"low carb\", \"sugar free\" and in this case \"organic\".  I must admit, I like to be very aware about what kind of food I am eating.  Cognizance and cuisine should be a given when making a wise choice about not only eating food, but what type of food.This is an organic raw fruit and nut bar by Pure, the flavor is \"cherry cashew\".  The first thing I noticed when I opened the wrapper is the bar isn\\'t very appetizing.  It looks like a small burnt fruit cake that was moist.  As for the taste, I found it to be very tart.  There is also this very acerbic aftertaste.  As for the texture, it was chewy and I felt like I had powder in my mouth. I realize this is a \"raw\" and \"organic\" fruit bar, but come on.  If that wasn\\'t enough, this bar is 190 calories and 8 grams of total fat, this fruit bar is small.  I suppose in this case organic doesn\\'t equal \"figure friendly\" or \"low in fat\".Overall, I didn\\'t even finish the bar.  I ate maybe half of it.  I can appreciate what Pure is doing by making and marketing an organic fruit bar; in contrast, when eating food taste is still paramount.  I also think that unneeded calories and high fat content shouldn\\'t be disguised as \"organic\".  Which leads me to believe how \"organic\" is this food product...?', u\"This nutritious snack bar is reasonably tasty, but it's texture could be improved. The surface is a bit slick, and the mouth feel a bit mealy. And because it's all natural, of course, it's quite expensive. I would probably buy a comparable product, such as a Clif Bar, before I would choose a Pure Bar.Individual 2.4-ounce Clif Bars are commonly on sale at stores in my area (Seattle) for $1, versus $20 for 12 1.7-ounce Pure Bars bars at Amazon (as of this posting), which works out to about $1 per ounce. So I would choose a different bar that both tastes better to me and saves me money, costing ounce for ounce less than half of what this one does.\", u'Safety InformationAllergy Statement: This product is manufactured in a facility that processes foods that may contain peanuts, tree nuts, soy, dairy, wheat, or eggs. Product contains walnuts, almonds, and cashews. May contain pieces of nuts, shells or pits.For those of us who have celiac disease (gluten problems) or wheat allergy the cross contamination issue is very real.  The warning says it is created in a facility that processes wheat and other common allergens.It looks good and sounds great until you read or notice the allergy warning.  I just wanted to emphasize the cross contamination issue which is serious.  That one point does not make it gluten free.', u\"Forget all those sugar-laden, chocolate coated granola and snack bars. The Pure bar is exactly what it says it is - pure fruit and nuts in a tasty bar that's perfect as an addition to lunch or for an on-the-go snack.There's no added sugar, or sodium in this bar. No cholesterol. Gluten-free. It's certified organic. It's a snack you can feel good about putting in your child's lunchbag.The blueberry bar had a good raw flavor - predominantly nuts (almonds, cashews and walnuts) - with the taste of wild blueberries. This healthy treat is one you don't have to feel guilty indulging in.\", u\"After I ate this bar, I didn't know if I liked it or not. I still don't know. On one hand, it's sweet and the blueberry taste is quite nice. On the other hand, it feels like it wants to be a granola or candy bar but it fails at both. It seems healthy, almost too healthy. Eating the thing made me feel like my colon was going to be very healthy afterwards.I think I'm going to say that I like it but it is a strange taste and I don't know if I can ever love it.\", u\"I'd say a 3.5 really, but not quite a 4...unless you have dietary restrictions that this bar satisfies...and then it's an easy 5. (Unless you are trying to avoid high levels of fructose...because this is sweetened by Agave Nectar)Totally organic, nothing processed and nothing cooked. No trans-fat, no processed sugars, and no gluten. A raw and tasty experience.The blueberry flavor is mild. The cashews add more crunch than flavor (and cashews are my favorite nut...I was surprised at how little cashewness these bars had). It's a little like a fig newton if you mooshed it all together and extruded it into a bar...but this has no flour or wheat in it.I am a little leery of the agave nectar, organic or not. Many health professionals liken it to high fructose corn syrup which is like snacking on a chemistry set...but agave has its defenders too. I do wonder how the bar would taste if it had no ADDED sweeteners and was allowed to survive on the natural sweetness of the fruits themselves. Now THAT would be PURE!\", u\"I was concerned that the nuts might overwhelm the flavor of this bar, but it was really good without any single flavor seeming to be overdone.  I would definitely eat it again if given the chance, but it wasn't so amazing that I'd seek it out to purchase.  What a relief to not have a bunch of artificial junk in food!\", u'many other products of this type do not work for us.  This one does very well!  I recommend it for sure.  no downer when you eat it.', u'I\\'ll go 5 stars on this \"Blueberry\" version from Pure Organic (I found the cherry bar to be too tart and had a disagreeable tar-like texture).  The blueberry was only slightly sticky.  The blueberry flavor comes through gently and very pleasantly. Nice nutlike flavor in the background with identifiable nut pieces in the bar.  The real deal as far as being uncooked, totally organic and free of chemicals or preservatives.  Not cheap, but a high end quality treat that makes a reasonably filling snack.', u\"I don't like nuts in my brownies, so this wasn't going to be for me.  I didn't really like it.  It's a dense bar though - you get quite a bit.  So I tried it on my family. My wife says she'd probably buy it, so I guess she liked it.  She said it's very natural (I agree).  My 6-year-old didn't care for it, and my 2-year-old thought it was chocolate so he was a little ticked when it turned out otherwise.  So 1 out of 4 for our family approves.\", u\"I'm a raw food person, and when I tried this bar, it tasted pretty yucky - kind of cardboard-y!  Not much flavor, and the texture of big soggy walnuts.  It's not very big either, but has 190 calories in each bar!  It looks like it has a lot of nutritious stuff in it, but if I'm going to take in 190 calories as a snack, I want something yummy and filling!  If you don't mind making your own bars, the best I've had are from a recipe in Matthew Kenney's Everyday Raw.\", u'This bar tastes very good, considering that it contains ONLY raw, organic ingredients, with no added sugar (raw or otherwise), no flour (no gluten - excellent for celiacs), no dairy, no soy, no trans fats, no preservatives, no flavor enhancers, etc.  In fact, the ingredient list is simple & straight forward:  organic dates, organic cashews, organic cherries, organic rice protein concentrate, organic walnuts, organic agave nectar & organic almonds - all raw & all unprocessed.  (Note:  for those whom the following may affect, there is a warning that the \"product is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, tree nuts\".)  Furthermore, the label states it contains a full daily serving of fruit, is rich in omega-3s, is vegan & certified organic.The taste is very cherry & nutty, with a bit of a bread-like back flavor, if you will, no doubt from the rice protein concentrate.  It is pleasantly sweet as well, due to the cherries & agave nectar.  In fact, I find the sweetness just right for my tastes, but I do not care for overly sweet foods in general.The texture is not disagreeable like some other \"health\" bars I\\'ve tried - not too gooey, but it stays together well & doesn\\'t crumble apart when you bite into it.  It is nice and chewy, but not overly so.It is somewhat high in calories at 190 per serving (one 1.7 ounce bar), and contains 8 grams total of fat (0.5 grams of saturated fat), 0 grams of cholesterol, only 5 milligrams of sodium, 7 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber & 17 grams of sugars (natural fruit sugars).  But, the natural sugars & protein would make it a good bar to have in my bicycle bag for a quick energy snack while riding.All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised by this bar.  In the interset of full disclosure, I am a middle-aged male who is far from a \"health food nut\" - in fact, I like a steak or a cheeseburger as much as the next guy!  But, this was a tasty, healthy snack that I would definitely buy - I look forward to trying the other varieties of the Pure Organic bar.', u\"I thought these were going to be nasty after I tried the blueberry flavor- It was early morning and I grabbed one to go for breakfast in the car.  I was disappointed as my first bite was really grainy and not very palatable.  Even worse was I didn't have any coffee or water to wash it down.  However I gave it another shot a few days later after my wife and kids said how much they loved them...nobody had the blueberry.  So I tried the chocolate one and agreed they were great.  I would avoid the blueberry, but if I had to eat it, it would be fine if you had something to wash it down.\", u\"I tried a blueberry bar and I thought it was real tasty. It had lots of nuts in it. Tastewise it worked for me.  I didn't really taste a whole lot of blueberry in it, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. It was not a very big bar but thicker than some-- denser I think, but not hard. The ingredient list looked reasonable. They seemed to be good quality.\", u\"My family loves these.  They are the perfect for when you don't have time for a meal - but don't want to resort to fast food.  I always keep one in my purse.\", u\"This bar has so much going for it. I loved how soft it was and the texture was great. I just personally did not care for the taste at all.  Even with all the healthy goodness I couldn't force myself to finish the bar.\", u\"I wasn't sure what to expect with these, but they are pretty tasty and you'll feel better about eating them because they're organic.\", u\"I was hesitant when I first opened this bar to eat it and I took a bite and then another.  It wasn't love at first bite, however by the second bite I truly could taste the natural flavors of the cherry and nuts.  I am hooked and will buy more of these for an on the go healthy food alternative.  I loved the tart cherries and crunchiness of the nuts, as well as knowing I am eating something that is healthy for my body!  Delicious and nutritious.!!\", u\"This was a pretty good mid-afternoon snack!  Cherry flavor can be intense, but here it was well-balanced with the cashews and rice protein blend.  I gobbled this down without looking at the ingredients, and it didn't stand out as being obviously organic in any way.  Then I looked at the wrapping and saw that it's gluten-free, refined sugar-free, and preservative-free.  So if you like granola bars but want something that's natural, this would fit the bill nicely.\", u'Any sort of snack bar that is marketed as being either organic or a more healthy alternative to candy bars are usually going to be a hit or miss affair, with most failing in the taste department.  The \"Pure Organic Wild Blueberry\" bar isn\\'t a total miss, but it doesn\\'t exactly hit a home run either.There is a significant amount of fat and sugar in the bar, but it\\'s all coming from fruit sugar and raw nuts, which automatically makes it a better choice than anything that has high fructose corn syrup as the first ingredient.  The bar also has small amounts of calcium and vitamin C, but significantly less of the vitamins and minerals typically found in health bars.  On the upside, absolutely everything is organic and nothing is cooked, so it has a huge appeal to anyone who prefers non-processed foods.As far as the taste is concerned it\\'s definitely not a candy bar or any other snack with loads of extra sugar.  It has a very mild blueberry flavor, which is pleasant, but not outstanding.  The texture is a winner however, as its incredibly chewy and moist.  Overall it seems like the flavor should be better for something that\\'s so packed with fruits and nuts. Aside from the flavor and nutrition aspects, the Pure bar does have another draw for environmentally conscious consumers.  Pure runs a campaign where they plant a tree for every three wrappers sent in to their headquarters, which may make them worth buying even if the flavor isn\\'t amazing.While the blueberry taste is toned down and the bar doesn\\'t offer as much extra nutritional value as the standard health food bar, it\\'s still worth a try for anyone who wants to see if they dig the texture or just wants to support an environmentally friendly product.', u\"At 190 calories, it isn't too heavy but does hit the spot.  Each bar does have 8 grams of fat, maybe that helps them satisfy the hunger.  The bars a firm and not crunchy.  These are gluten free too, which is handy.  You never know when a gluten sensitive person in your group is going to bonk and need some food pronto.The nutrition and diet folk say that we should eat something every few hours, these bars are just fine for between meal grazing.  They'd also be good for a quick feeding while hiking or back packing.As for the organic claims, they seem legit.  You have to wonder a bit about your food sources these days.  Especially some of the organic claims.  I think these bars are OK on that count.I'm posting very similar reviews for this, the blueberry flavor, to the one I posted over on the page for the cherry flavor.  I've tried both.  They taste very similar with one tasting somewhat of cherry and the other of blueberry.  Both are good.  I guess that's amazing for something that claims to have no sodium.  Actually, these things are pretty dang healthy yet manage to taste fine.\", u\"I reviewed this itemPure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)without the knowledge that these bars contain dates as their main ingredient.  Not cherries and not blueberry (the latter does have blueberry with the dates).  So to me, they taste like a fig cookie that has been soaked in grape juice, leaving it saturated and slightly sticky.  The taste is decent, a tiny bit gritty, but ok, as I find in other raw food items, like any bread type items always seem to be gritty.  I wouldn't buy them myself, but I would take one in someone offered me one, say, if I was hiking.\", u\"I was only given one bar to review, so I don't know how much of a difference there is from one bar to the next, but I did not taste the blueberries. To me, it tasted like a cross between a fruit cake and bran cereal...don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad, but I will stick withPowerBar Fruit Smoothiesfor now.If you are not a fan of Powerbars though, this might be the protein snack you are looking for; I was impressed with the ingredients, regardless of the taste.\", u\"Cherry Cashew is tasty, but it's soft like an oatmeal cookie. I could not taste the cashews, but there are nice big pieces of nuts and fruits... but... all those pieces are not crunchy, just moist. I'd love more crunch, but then again, it's very tough to compare this one to my favorite snack - Nature Valley's Oats and Honey - because the Honey bar has so much crunch and honey taste. This Pure bar is not sugary, in fact, it's a little tart. Overall, I'd eat again, but would not buy.\", u'I tried out both the cherry cashew bar and the wild blueberry bar and found the wild blueberry quite a bit tastier. My first reaction to the cherry cashew was \"this tastes like \\'health food\\'\"--maybe a good thing to some, but admittedly, I\\'ve got a sweet tooth and found the earthy taste rather bland. The cherries do add a tangy kick, but I would have preferred it to balance the tanginess with more sweetness. The texture is chewy and somewhat grainy, with a bit of nutty crunch. What the cherry cashew bar lacks in taste it makes up somewhat in its hearty, satisfying quality. It\\'s organic, vegan, gluten free, and all-natural, making it a healthy snack. It\\'s a great energy pick-me-up, rich in protein (7g), fiber (3g), and a variety of vitamins and minerals (though not incredibly large amounts of these--it\\'s no true substitute for fresh fruit). The bars have 190 calories (70g of fat, with no saturated or trans fat). This flavor wouldn\\'t be my first pick, but they\\'re not bad, and they\\'re certainly not bad for you.', u\"I hate to give poor reviews but I have to say, I would not buy these. The blueberry bar was dry, dense and not very flavorful. The texture was grainy. It was NOT moist. I like granola bars, fig newtons, all of that stuff. I also like flavor.  I didn't care for it and would not recommend it, to be blunt. Not much else to say. The wrapper was pretty, it was well sealed in a foil-type packaging, but the first bite was disappointing and not to my taste at all.\", u\"I've tried so many different types of 'healthy, natural' bars and they mostly taste pretty awful. Either they smell odd, sit like a brick in your stomach, or just taste bad. But these Pure Bars are pretty awesome, I must say. All organic ingredients, no sugar, and they actually taste really good. There's a nice scent to them as soon as I ripped open the packaging and also, just the right amount of sweetness. I can find no complaints with these bars. So far, these are the only brand that I would recommend.\", u\"These bars are great! I used these as snack food on a plane and at a hotel and they do a great job staving off hunger between meals.The banana coconut was my favorite; I'd buy again if I didn't find Lara Bars.\", u\"Taste is the most important thing.This is tart and it tastes great.It's great to keep in a backpack or office drawer so that you don't get junk at the vending machine.It's not a substitute for a meal or anything but a nice little snack.\", u\"I imagine if cavemen had candy, this would be it. Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry bars are very tasty, nutrient(and calorie) dense bars of fruits and nuts. It has a nice blueberry flavor with a strong taste of something like dates. If you ever had a date bar- they are usually rolled in coconut and have an almond in the middle- than you can get a general idea of what these taste like. These are perfect snacks for vegan, paleo or gluten-free diets, but I wouldn't include them on low-carb or low-calorie eating plans. For those wanting something without preservatives and chock-full of healthy and tasty ingredients, these fit the bill.\", u\"Excellent flavor, soft and moist. Low sodium content and a good source for a quick carb refill. They make a nice snack at work or before a workout. They are not easy to find in stores, but I've bought these at some local stores and they are available from Amazon.\", u\"I've got to preface this with the fact that my child is the pickiest eater in the world.  But, she's quickly devouring her half of this bar!  I think the 19 grams on sugar per bar is helpful in getting my picky eater to enjoy it.  I like it very much as well, although I could do without the lemon juice concentrate.  I personally am not liking that flavor in there, but it's not bad enough that I don't want to eat it.  I like that the bar is soft and easy to bite into.  I dislike other bars that are tough to chew.  Finally, the massive amount of nuts in this bar is great!!\", u'An excellent product that is high in fiber and low calorie. It is soft fruit bar that is a mix of a pure fruit and grain/nuts. Ingredients are natural. Excellent taste in multiple flavors that I have tried.', u\"These things are strange and addictive. Kind of mushy, think cookie dough consistency. I love that they're organic and relatively healthy. The blueberry flavor is great.\", u'I got this bar from amazon vine program as a free sample.  It sucked that they told me pack of 12 when I got sent 1 bar lol.  Not much to say, its a good fruit bar.', u\"My daughter and I liked these bars.  The texture is a bit odd, kinda gritty but that's probably the healthy stuff swirling through!\", u\"If you don't call this a snack bar, I wouldn't know what else you'd call it but they sure taste great. I eat several different kinds and brands - though mostly the fruit varieties - and they all lack something, yet these have a wonderful combination of ingredients. The cranberry orange combination is just right in terms of tartness, not too sweet, a little crunchy, not too dense, you really feel like you are eating something filling and healthy. They are pretty popular I think because Amazon tends to run out of them quite frequently. Highly recommended.\", u\"This bar is rather good - larger than others so it's packed with nuts and is very sweet, but it's a natural tasting sweetness due to the bar having no added sugar. Surprisingly tasty too given that I'm not normally a fan of dates (the predominant ingredient). I look forward to trying other flavors.Now I do have a couple of caveats - the bar comes in at a hefty 190 calories so it's not a weight-loss health bar. Plus quite a few potential ingredients are stated under its allergy text on the back - you know the bit that says 'this product was made in a factory that also makes...'. Aside from the usual suspects, nuts, milk etc one of them was fish which is a little disconcerting for vegetarians.Thumbs up but don't eat too many of them!\", u'This raw fruit and nut bar is rather gluey in texture and has no particular taste except sweet.  There are 190 calories per bar of which 70 are from fat.  The foil wrapper has a rather scary warning printed on it that the bar may contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.', u'When I want a snack, I don\\'t care if it\\'s good for me. I just want it to taste good. I tried this bar because I like cherries, and I like nuts. I figured we were off to a pretty good start right there. I was wrong.The number one ingredient on the lable turned out to be dates. Dates? Yep. Dates. Apparently the dates and some rice protien makes up the soft-cookie-like, chewy base. I shared the bar with a friend, and I thought the base was mostly flavorless, but she thought it tasted like prunes.While the label says \"cashew\", there are also walnuts and almonds in the bar. I thought the walnut taste overwhelmed the cashew taste, but that could be because I\\'m sensitive to walnuts. My throat tingled for an hour after eating the bar. Someone with a more severe walnut allergy might have great issue with a cashew bar that has walnuts in it.The cherries were tart, but there were so few in the bar that it was possible to take a bite and not get any cherries. Perhaps they should have infused the date/rice protien base with some cherry juice to get some more flavor in the bar.I suppose if you\\'re used to eating flavorless things like rice cakes and unsalted granolla this might be a nice bar for a snack. But if you eat like a normal person, this bar is just something to gnaw on. It\\'s not a very satisfying snack at all.As I swallow, I\\'m reminded to recount one important point I learned trying this bar: Absolutely stay away from it if you\\'re allergic to walnuts.', u'I tried this Pure Bar, and I liked it. I am comforted by the ingredients: lots of protein, and both vitamins and minerals. My doctors want me to have more protein and fiber and less sodium and cholesterol.  \"Pure Bar\" fits the doctor\\'s orders.\"The Pure Bar Organic Blueberry\"  has six grams of protein, and twenty-six grams of carbohydrate with 3 grams of fiber.  It also has 19 grams of natural fruit sugars, eight grams of fat, but has only 190 calories.  It is also gluten free and contains zero sodium.Since the label mentions \"organic dates, organic rice protein concentrate, and apple juice and lemon juice as well as blueberry, it is tough to decide on a name for the \"taste\"  The taste is not great. It is a bit fruity but not distinctly blueberry.Prue Organic Wild Blueberry bar is much better for my health than most other snack and energy bar that I have seen on the market. It doesn\\'t takes as good as a candy bar or an ice cream sunday, but it is much better for me. I highly recommend Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar for anyone interested in a healthy snack bar.', u'The ingredients are impressive and all...but the bottom line is... they taste badly..  Too bad!!', u'Definitely one of the better nutrition bars I\\'ve eaten. I don\\'t really care in the slightest about \"organic\" food, but if something is healthy and tastes good, I\\'m all for it. I\\'d recommend this over most of the other alternatives out there (balance bars, power bars, cliff bars, etc.)If you need a gluten free diet, this is a must-buy, IMO.', u\"The flavor of these bars is good, but the texture is a little weird.  They're not at all crunchy or like a granola bar.  It's somewhere between a power bar and a fig newton.\", u'All the technical specs about this product gave me the idea it would taste pretty bland, but it was real good!  I liked it more than other bars of this type (Oddwala et al).  The fruit mixture was not too pulpy, not too sweet -- just right, and just enough fresh-tasting nut pieces blended in to give it a bit of a crunch.  I will definitely be buying more of these bars!', u'These Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bars are not the normal crunchy snack bar, but a date based  bar with 190 calories each, so presumably they would make a good energy bar. They are gluten free with no preservatives, but the bar I had had an expiration date 9 months from the time I received it, so that is a pretty good shelf life for a natural no preservative food.Two of us in the household tasted the bar and thought it was tasty and fruity, it is chewy and soft. It has a cherry taste, but the main taste are the dates, the nuts seem to be ground very fine. It does have a high price in my opinion for a 1.7 oz snack, but natural foods seem to have a higher price than the every day snack items. So if it serves your needs and wants as a natural- gluten free - preservative free - 190 calorie snack it would be perfect for you.', u\"Not sugary sweet or overly sour. I liked this bar more than I thought I would. It is small, but the flavor was nice and fresh, the texture was easy to chew, but not over-processed. Ingredients are fresh tasting and feeling. This bar is a nice snack that doesn't give you a blood sugar spike and then leave you feeling yucky. I would buy more of these.\", u'These \"Pure Bars\" are essentially date bars with excessive marketing. Dates are the first ingredient on the list, and they are what are holding together everything else.  This bar is mostly mashed up dates gluing together a collection of fruits, nuts and oats. They aren\\'t bad, but nor are they particularly wonderful.  They are pretty much standard issue for this type of snack.The bars are super dense, not as chewy as a Powerbar, but still give your teeth a workout biting off a chunk.  I had the opportunity to try the Wild Blueberry bar as well, and with both bars it is difficult to distinguish the featured flavor.I passed a few pieces of this \"Cherry Cashew\" bar around to some friends in a blind taste test, and none of them was able to guess that the intended flavor was cherry.  The overwhelming response was \"dates\" along with \"fruitcake.\"  Honestly, after eating both the blueberry and the cherry, there wasn\\'t a considerable difference in flavor.Which isn\\'t so bad.  I happen to like fruitcake, and so the bar was good enough that I was happy to eat it.  If you are looking for a healthy snack, this is probably as good as the rest. I thought it was tasty, and would eat them if available. But it is nothing amazing.', u\"We usually get the variety pack of Pure bars and we like them all. Then I saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It's another winner! Great tasting bar and it's healthy.Highly recommended.\", u\"Depending on your outlook this could be a great snack bar or just a pretty good fruit and nut bar. It's clearly an extremely healthy treat at 190 calories (0 sodium, 0 cholesterol, plenty of Potassium and other nutrients) but the drawback is that it tastes like health food - bland. Health nuts (like myself) might not mind sacrificing a little bit of flavor for nutrition but most consumers (health food fiend or not) have come to expect a certain level of taste in even the healthiest foods. This bar gets 5 stars on nutrition - organic, gluten-free, vegan, no preservatives, etc., but a 3 (barely) on taste, so it averages out to a 4.\", u'If you like the taste of cherry you will like the taste of this fruit and nut bar. The matrix is the consistency of cookie dough.  For me, the flavor was too shrill and acidic, but the nuts tasted fresh. If you are an alkaline person who loves sour pickles, this bar will appeal to you.  At almost 200 calories, 70 of them fat, I found it too small to be worth the bother.']\n"
